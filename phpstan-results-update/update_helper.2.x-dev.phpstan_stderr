Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - drupal/update_helper dev-2.x requires chi-teck/drupal-code-generator ^1.32.0 -> found chi-teck/drupal-code-generator[1.32.0, ..., 1.x-dev] but the package is fixed to 2.4.1 (lock file version) by a partial update and that version does not match. Make sure you list it as an argument for the update command.
    - drupal/update_helper 2.x-dev is an alias of drupal/update_helper dev-2.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/update_helper 2.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/update_helper[2.x-dev (alias of dev-2.x)].

Use the option --with-all-dependencies (-W) to allow upgrades, downgrades and removals for packages currently locked to specific versions.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
