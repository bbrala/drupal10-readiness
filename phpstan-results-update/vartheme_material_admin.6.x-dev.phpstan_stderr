  Problem 1
    - oomphinc/composer-installers-extender v1.1.2 requires composer-plugin-api ^1.0 -> found composer-plugin-api[2.3.0] but it does not match the constraint.
    - drupal/vartheme_material_admin 6.x-dev is an alias of drupal/vartheme_material_admin dev-6.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/vartheme_material_admin dev-6.x requires oomphinc/composer-installers-extender ^1.1.2 -> satisfiable by oomphinc/composer-installers-extender[v1.1.2].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/vartheme_material_admin 6.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/vartheme_material_admin[6.x-dev (alias of dev-6.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
