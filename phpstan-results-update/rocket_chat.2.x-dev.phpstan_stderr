Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - drupal/rocket_chat[dev-2.x, 2.x-dev] require php ^7.2 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - drupal/rocket_chat 2.x-dev is an alias of drupal/rocket_chat dev-2.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/rocket_chat 2.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/rocket_chat[2.x-dev (alias of dev-2.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
