Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - auth0/auth0-php[5.1.0, ..., 5.7.0] require php ^5.5 || ^7.0 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - drupal/auth0 9.0.x-dev is an alias of drupal/auth0 dev-9.0.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/auth0 dev-9.0.x requires auth0/auth0-php ^5.1 -> satisfiable by auth0/auth0-php[5.1.0, ..., 5.7.0].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/auth0 9.0.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/auth0[9.0.x-dev (alias of dev-9.0.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
