Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - drupal/gearbox dev-1.x requires php ^7.4 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - drupal/gearbox 1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/gearbox dev-1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/gearbox 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/gearbox[1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
