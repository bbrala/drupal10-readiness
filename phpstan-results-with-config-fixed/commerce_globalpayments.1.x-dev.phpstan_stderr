Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - realexpayments/rxp-remote-php dev-master requires symfony/serializer 2.7.* -> found symfony/serializer[v2.7.0-BETA1, ..., 2.7.x-dev] but the package is fixed to v4.4.35 (lock file version) by a partial update and that version does not match. Make sure you list it as an argument for the update command.
    - drupal/commerce_globalpayments 1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/commerce_globalpayments dev-1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/commerce_globalpayments dev-1.x requires realexpayments/rxp-remote-php dev-master -> satisfiable by realexpayments/rxp-remote-php[dev-master].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/commerce_globalpayments 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/commerce_globalpayments[1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)].

Use the option --with-all-dependencies (-W) to allow upgrades, downgrades and removals for packages currently locked to specific versions.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
