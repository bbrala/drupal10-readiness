Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - cache/cache 0.4.0 requires php ^5.6 || ^7.0 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - drupal/vault dev-1.x requires csharpru/vault-php ^3.6 -> satisfiable by csharpru/vault-php[3.6.0].
    - drupal/vault 1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/vault dev-1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - csharpru/vault-php 3.6.0 requires cache/cache ^0.4.0 -> satisfiable by cache/cache[0.4.0].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/vault 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/vault[1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
