Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - farmos/farmos 2.0.0-beta3 requires drupal/core 9.3.7 -> satisfiable by drupal/core[9.3.7] from composer repo (https://repo.packagist.org) but drupal/core[9.4.x-dev] from path repo (core) has higher repository priority. The packages from the higher priority repository do not match your constraint and are therefore not installable. That repository is canonical so the lower priority repo's packages are not installable. See https://getcomposer.org/repoprio for details and assistance.
    - farmos/farmos 2.0.0-beta4 requires drupal/core 9.3.9 -> satisfiable by drupal/core[9.3.9] from composer repo (https://repo.packagist.org) but drupal/core[9.4.x-dev] from path repo (core) has higher repository priority. The packages from the higher priority repository do not match your constraint and are therefore not installable. That repository is canonical so the lower priority repo's packages are not installable. See https://getcomposer.org/repoprio for details and assistance.
    - farmos/farmos[2.0.0-beta5, ..., 2.x-dev] require drupal/core 9.3.15 -> satisfiable by drupal/core[9.3.15] from composer repo (https://repo.packagist.org) but drupal/core[9.4.x-dev] from path repo (core) has higher repository priority. The packages from the higher priority repository do not match your constraint and are therefore not installable. That repository is canonical so the lower priority repo's packages are not installable. See https://getcomposer.org/repoprio for details and assistance.
    - drupal/farm_myfarmkey 1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/farm_myfarmkey dev-1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/farm_myfarmkey dev-1.x requires farmos/farmos ^2.0.0-beta3 -> satisfiable by farmos/farmos[2.0.0-beta3, 2.0.0-beta4, 2.0.0-beta5, 2.x-dev].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/farm_myfarmkey 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/farm_myfarmkey[1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)].
