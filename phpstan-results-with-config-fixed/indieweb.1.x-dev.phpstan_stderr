Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - lcobucci/jwt[3.4.0, ..., 3.4.x-dev] require php ^5.6 || ^7.0 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - drupal/indieweb 1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/indieweb dev-1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/indieweb dev-1.x requires lcobucci/jwt ^3.4 -> satisfiable by lcobucci/jwt[3.4.0, ..., 3.4.x-dev].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/indieweb 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/indieweb[1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
