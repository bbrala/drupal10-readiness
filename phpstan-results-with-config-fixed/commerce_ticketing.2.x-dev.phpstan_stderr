  Problem 1
    - drupal/commerce[2.0.0-alpha1, ..., 2.0.0-alpha3] require drupal/core ^8 -> satisfiable by drupal/core[8.0.0-beta6, ..., 8.9.x-dev] from composer repo (https://repo.packagist.org) but drupal/core[9.4.x-dev] from path repo (core) has higher repository priority. The packages from the higher priority repository do not match your constraint and are therefore not installable. That repository is canonical so the lower priority repo's packages are not installable. See https://getcomposer.org/repoprio for details and assistance.
    - drupal/commerce 2.0.0-alpha4 requires drupal/core ~8.1 -> satisfiable by drupal/core[8.1.0-beta1, ..., 8.9.x-dev] from composer repo (https://repo.packagist.org) but drupal/core[9.4.x-dev] from path repo (core) has higher repository priority. The packages from the higher priority repository do not match your constraint and are therefore not installable. That repository is canonical so the lower priority repo's packages are not installable. See https://getcomposer.org/repoprio for details and assistance.
    - drupal/commerce[2.0.0-beta1, ..., 2.0.0-beta6] require drupal/core ~8.2 -> satisfiable by drupal/core[8.2.0-beta1, ..., 8.9.x-dev] from composer repo (https://repo.packagist.org) but drupal/core[9.4.x-dev] from path repo (core) has higher repository priority. The packages from the higher priority repository do not match your constraint and are therefore not installable. That repository is canonical so the lower priority repo's packages are not installable. See https://getcomposer.org/repoprio for details and assistance.
    - drupal/commerce[2.0.0-beta7, ..., 2.0.0] require drupal/core ~8.3 -> satisfiable by drupal/core[8.3.0-alpha1, ..., 8.9.x-dev] from composer repo (https://repo.packagist.org) but drupal/core[9.4.x-dev] from path repo (core) has higher repository priority. The packages from the higher priority repository do not match your constraint and are therefore not installable. That repository is canonical so the lower priority repo's packages are not installable. See https://getcomposer.org/repoprio for details and assistance.
    - drupal/commerce[2.1.0, ..., 2.4.0] require drupal/core ~8.4 -> satisfiable by drupal/core[8.4.0-alpha1, ..., 8.9.x-dev] from composer repo (https://repo.packagist.org) but drupal/core[9.4.x-dev] from path repo (core) has higher repository priority. The packages from the higher priority repository do not match your constraint and are therefore not installable. That repository is canonical so the lower priority repo's packages are not installable. See https://getcomposer.org/repoprio for details and assistance.
    - drupal/commerce[2.5.0, ..., 2.9.0] require drupal/core ~8.5 -> satisfiable by drupal/core[8.5.0-alpha1, ..., 8.9.x-dev] from composer repo (https://repo.packagist.org) but drupal/core[9.4.x-dev] from path repo (core) has higher repository priority.

    - drupal/commerce[2.10.0, ..., 2.14.0] require drupal/core ^8.6 -> satisfiable by drupal/core[8.6.0-alpha1, ..., 8.9.x-dev] from composer repo (https://repo.packagist.org) but drupal/core[9.4.x-dev] from path repo (core) has higher repository priority. The packages from the higher priority repository do not match your constraint and are therefore not installable. That repository is canonical so the lower priority repo's packages are not installable. See https://getcomposer.org/repoprio for details and assistance.
    - drupal/commerce[2.15.0, ..., 2.16.0] require drupal/core ^8.7 -> satisfiable by drupal/core[8.7.0-alpha1, ..., 8.9.x-dev] from composer repo (https://repo.packagist.org) but drupal/core[9.4.x-dev] from path repo (core) has higher repository priority.

    - drupal/commerce[dev-2.x, dev-3.0.x, 2.17.0, ..., 2.x-dev, 3.0.x-dev] require ext-bcmath * -> it is missing from your system. Install or enable PHP's bcmath extension.
    - drupal/commerce_ticketing 2.x-dev is an alias of drupal/commerce_ticketing dev-2.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/commerce_ticketing dev-2.x requires drupal/commerce ^2 -> satisfiable by drupal/commerce[2.0.0-alpha1, ..., 2.x-dev].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/commerce_ticketing 2.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/commerce_ticketing[2.x-dev (alias of dev-2.x)].

To enable extensions, verify that they are enabled in your .ini files:
    - 
    - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-gd.ini
    - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-sodium.ini
    - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-zip.ini
    - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/memory.ini
You can also run `php --ini` in a terminal to see which files are used by PHP in CLI mode.
Alternatively, you can run Composer with `--ignore-platform-req=ext-bcmath` to temporarily ignore these required extensions.

Use the option --with-all-dependencies (-W) to allow upgrades, downgrades and removals for packages currently locked to specific versions.
