Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - drupal/auto_login_url[2.0.0-alpha1, ..., 2.x-dev] require drush/drush ^10.0 -> found drush/drush[10.0.0-alpha1, ..., 10.x-dev] but it conflicts with your root composer.json require (11.0.3).
    - drupal/bt_image 2.0.0-alpha1 requires drupal/core ^8.8 -> satisfiable by drupal/core[8.8.0-alpha1, ..., 8.9.x-dev] from composer repo (https://repo.packagist.org) but drupal/core[9.4.x-dev] from path repo (core) has higher repository priority. The packages from the higher priority repository do not match your constraint and are therefore not installable. That repository is canonical so the lower priority repo's packages are not installable. See https://getcomposer.org/repoprio for details and assistance.
    - drupal/bt_image[2.0.0-alpha2, ..., 2.x-dev] require drupal/bt_media ^2.0.0-alpha1 -> satisfiable by drupal/bt_media[2.0.0-alpha1, 2.x-dev].
    - drupal/bt_media[2.0.0-alpha1, ..., 2.x-dev] require drupal/bt_cms ^2.0.0-alpha1 -> satisfiable by drupal/bt_cms[2.0.0-alpha1, 2.0.0-alpha2, 2.x-dev].
    - drupal/bt_blog dev-2.x requires drupal/bt_image ^2.0.0-alpha1 -> satisfiable by drupal/bt_image[2.0.0-alpha1, 2.0.0-alpha2, 2.x-dev].
    - drupal/bt_cms[2.0.0-alpha1, ..., 2.x-dev] require drupal/bt_core ^2.0.0-alpha3 -> satisfiable by drupal/bt_core[2.0.0-alpha3, 2.0.0-alpha4, 2.0.0-alpha5, 2.x-dev].
    - drupal/bt_blog 2.x-dev is an alias of drupal/bt_blog dev-2.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/bt_core[2.0.0-alpha3, ..., 2.x-dev] require drupal/auto_login_url ^2.0.0-alpha1 -> satisfiable by drupal/auto_login_url[2.0.0-alpha1, 2.x-dev].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/bt_blog 2.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/bt_blog[2.x-dev (alias of dev-2.x)].
