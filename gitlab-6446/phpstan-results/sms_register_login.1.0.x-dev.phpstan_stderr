Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - drupal/sms_user[dev-1.x, 1.0.0-beta1, ..., 1.x-dev] require drupal/core ^8 -> satisfiable by drupal/core[8.0.0-beta6, ..., 8.9.x-dev] from composer repo (https://repo.packagist.org) but drupal/core[9.4.x-dev] from path repo (core) has higher repository priority. The packages from the higher priority repository do not match your constraint and are therefore not installable. That repository is canonical so the lower priority repo's packages are not installable. See https://getcomposer.org/repoprio for details and assistance.
    - drupal/sms_user[dev-2.x, dev-2.1.x, dev-2.2.x, 2.0.0-alpha1, ..., 2.x-dev] require drupal/user ^5.0 -> could not be found in any version, there may be a typo in the package name.
    - drupal/sms_register_login 1.0.x-dev is an alias of drupal/sms_register_login dev-1.0.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/sms_register_login dev-1.0.x requires drupal/sms_user * -> satisfiable by drupal/sms_user[dev-1.x, dev-2.x, dev-2.1.x, dev-2.2.x, 1.0.0-beta1, ..., 1.x-dev, 2.0.0-alpha1, ..., 2.x-dev].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/sms_register_login 1.0.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/sms_register_login[1.0.x-dev (alias of dev-1.0.x)].

Potential causes:
 - A typo in the package name
 - The package is not available in a stable-enough version according to your minimum-stability setting
   see <https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#minimum-stability> for more details.
 - It's a private package and you forgot to add a custom repository to find it

Read <https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/troubleshooting.md> for further common problems.

Use the option --with-all-dependencies (-W) to allow upgrades, downgrades and removals for packages currently locked to specific versions.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
