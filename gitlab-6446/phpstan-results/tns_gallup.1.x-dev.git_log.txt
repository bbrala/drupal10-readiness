    Prepare module for Drupal 9

    Convert to Drupal 8
    
    This converts the module to Drupal 8. Notable changes:
    
    - The module no longer injects javascript into the page. This is
    discouraged in Drupal 8. Instead a library is used. Initialization is included as a standalone Javascript file. spring.js is loaded
    asynchronously.
    
    - Noscript markup and libraries are included using
    hook_preprocess_html() instead of hook_page_build as that has been
    removed from Drupal 8.
    
    - Testing is done using unit tests instead of web tests. They run much
    faster although coverage is not 1:1.
    
    - Drush integration has not been tested.

    Check existence of script before inclusion on page.
    
    Before we just assumed the spring.js script was accessible when we
    included the script in the page.
    
    Unfortunately when the script was included in the page (with an illegal
    path) it was too easy to miss the error even if it was displayed in the
    status report.
    
    Now we don't try to include anything at all if spring.js doesn't
    exist. That should be hint enough that something is wrong - and the
    error will still be explained in the status report.
