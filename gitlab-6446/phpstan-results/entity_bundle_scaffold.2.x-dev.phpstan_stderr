Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - drupal/entity_bundle_scaffold dev-2.x requires drush/drush ^11.0.5 -> found drush/drush[11.0.5, ..., 11.x-dev] but it conflicts with your root composer.json require (11.0.3).
    - drupal/entity_bundle_scaffold 2.x-dev is an alias of drupal/entity_bundle_scaffold dev-2.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/entity_bundle_scaffold 2.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/entity_bundle_scaffold[2.x-dev (alias of dev-2.x)].

Use the option --with-all-dependencies (-W) to allow upgrades, downgrades and removals for packages currently locked to specific versions.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
