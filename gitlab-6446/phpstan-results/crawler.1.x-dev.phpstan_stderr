Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - spatie/image[1.5.3, ..., 1.7.6] require php ^7.0 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - spatie/browsershot[3.14.0, ..., 3.20.0] require php ^7.0 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - spatie/image[1.7.7, ..., v1.x-dev, 2.0.0, ..., 2.2.4] require ext-exif * -> it is missing from your system. Install or enable PHP's exif extension.
    - spatie/browsershot[3.20.1, ..., 3.40.2] require php ^7.1 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - spatie/crawler[4.6.0, ..., 4.7.5] require php ^7.1 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - spatie/browsershot[3.40.3, ..., 3.46.0] require symfony/process ^5.0 -> found symfony/process[v5.0.0-BETA1, ..., 5.4.x-dev] but the package is fixed to v4.4.44 (lock file version) by a partial update and that version does not match. Make sure you list it as an argument for the update command.
    - spatie/crawler v4.x-dev requires guzzlehttp/guzzle ^7.2 -> found guzzlehttp/guzzle[dev-master, 7.2.0, ..., 7.4.x-dev (alias of dev-master)] but the package is fixed to 6.5.5 (lock file version) by a partial update and that version does not match. Make sure you list it as an argument for the update command.
    - drupal/crawler dev-1.x requires spatie/crawler ^4.6 -> satisfiable by spatie/crawler[4.6.0, ..., v4.x-dev].
    - spatie/crawler 4.7.6 requires spatie/browsershot ^3.14 -> satisfiable by spatie/browsershot[3.14.0, ..., 3.57.1].
    - drupal/crawler 1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/crawler dev-1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - spatie/browsershot 3.47.0 requires spatie/image ^1.5.3 -> satisfiable by spatie/image[1.5.3, ..., v1.x-dev].
    - spatie/browsershot[3.48.0, ..., 3.57.1] require spatie/image ^1.5.3|^2.0 -> satisfiable by spatie/image[1.5.3, ..., v1.x-dev, 2.0.0, ..., 2.2.4].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/crawler 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/crawler[1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)].

To enable extensions, verify that they are enabled in your .ini files:
    - 
    - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-gd.ini
    - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-sodium.ini
    - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-zip.ini
    - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/memory.ini
You can also run `php --ini` in a terminal to see which files are used by PHP in CLI mode.
Alternatively, you can run Composer with `--ignore-platform-req=ext-exif` to temporarily ignore these required extensions.

Use the option --with-all-dependencies (-W) to allow upgrades, downgrades and removals for packages currently locked to specific versions.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
