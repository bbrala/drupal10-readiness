Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - cpliakas/git-wrapper 1.7.0 requires symfony/process ~2.3|~3.0 -> found symfony/process[v2.3.0, ..., 2.8.x-dev, v3.0.0-BETA1, ..., 3.4.x-dev] but the package is fixed to v4.4.44 (lock file version) by a partial update and that version does not match. Make sure you list it as an argument for the update command.
    - cpliakas/git-wrapper v2.2.0 requires php ^7.1.3 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - drupal/config_tools 1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/config_tools dev-1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/config_tools dev-1.x requires cpliakas/git-wrapper ^1.7|^2.2 -> satisfiable by cpliakas/git-wrapper[1.7.0, v2.2.0].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/config_tools 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/config_tools[1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)].

Use the option --with-all-dependencies (-W) to allow upgrades, downgrades and removals for packages currently locked to specific versions.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
