  Problem 1
    - drupal/b2b dev-2.0.x requires oro/commerce 1.x-dev -> found oro/commerce[dev-master, ..., dev-5.1-alpha.2, 1.0.0-alpha.1, ..., 1.6.x-dev, 3.0.0-beta, ..., 3.1.x-dev, 4.0.0-beta, ..., 4.2.x-dev, 5.0.0-alpha.1, ..., 5.1.x-dev (alias of dev-master)] but it does not match the constraint.
    - drupal/b2b 2.0.x-dev is an alias of drupal/b2b dev-2.0.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/b2b 2.0.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/b2b[2.0.x-dev (alias of dev-2.0.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
