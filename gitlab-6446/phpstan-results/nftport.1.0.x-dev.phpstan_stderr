Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - simplito/elliptic-php[1.0.6, ..., 1.0.10] require ext-gmp * -> it is missing from your system. Install or enable PHP's gmp extension.
    - sc0vu/web3.php dev-master requires php ^7.1 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - drupal/nft[1.0.0, ..., 1.0.2] require drupal:oembed_providers ^2.0 -> could not be found, it looks like its name is invalid, ":" is not allowed in package names.
    - drupal/nft 2.0.x-dev is an alias of drupal/nft dev-2.0.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/nftport dev-1.0.x requires drupal/nft * -> satisfiable by drupal/nft[dev-1.0.x, dev-2.0.x, 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.x-dev (alias of dev-1.0.x), 2.0.x-dev (alias of dev-2.0.x)].
    - drupal/nft[dev-2.0.x, 2.0.x-dev] require web3p/ethereum-tx dev-master -> satisfiable by web3p/ethereum-tx[dev-master].
    - drupal/nft 1.0.x-dev is an alias of drupal/nft dev-1.0.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/nftport 1.0.x-dev is an alias of drupal/nftport dev-1.0.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - web3p/ethereum-tx dev-master requires simplito/elliptic-php ~1.0.6 -> satisfiable by simplito/elliptic-php[1.0.6, ..., 1.0.10].
    - drupal/nft[dev-1.0.x, 1.0.x-dev] require sc0vu/web3.php dev-master -> satisfiable by sc0vu/web3.php[dev-master].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/nftport 1.0.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/nftport[1.0.x-dev (alias of dev-1.0.x)].

Potential causes:
 - A typo in the package name
 - The package is not available in a stable-enough version according to your minimum-stability setting
   see <https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#minimum-stability> for more details.
 - It's a private package and you forgot to add a custom repository to find it

Read <https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/troubleshooting.md> for further common problems.

To enable extensions, verify that they are enabled in your .ini files:
    - 
    - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-gd.ini
    - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-sodium.ini
    - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-zip.ini
    - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/memory.ini
You can also run `php --ini` in a terminal to see which files are used by PHP in CLI mode.
Alternatively, you can run Composer with `--ignore-platform-req=ext-gmp` to temporarily ignore these required extensions.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
