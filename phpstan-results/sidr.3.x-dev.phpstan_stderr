Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - drupal/sidr dev-3.x requires npm-asset/sidr 2.2.1 -> could not be found in any version, there may be a typo in the package name.
    - drupal/sidr 3.x-dev is an alias of drupal/sidr dev-3.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/sidr 3.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/sidr[3.x-dev (alias of dev-3.x)].

Potential causes:
 - A typo in the package name
 - The package is not available in a stable-enough version according to your minimum-stability setting
   see <https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#minimum-stability> for more details.
 - It's a private package and you forgot to add a custom repository to find it

Read <https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/troubleshooting.md> for further common problems.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
