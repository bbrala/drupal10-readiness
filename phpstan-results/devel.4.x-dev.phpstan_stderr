Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - doctrine/common[v2.7.0, ..., 2.7.x-dev] require php ~5.6|~7.0 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - doctrine/common[v2.8.0, ..., 2.8.x-dev] require php ~7.1 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - doctrine/common[v2.9.0, ..., 2.13.0] require php ^7.1 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - doctrine/common[2.13.1, ..., 2.13.x-dev] require doctrine/inflector ^1.0 -> found doctrine/inflector[v1.0, ..., 1.4.x-dev] but the package is fixed to 2.0.4 (lock file version) by a partial update and that version does not match. Make sure you list it as an argument for the update command.
    - drupal/devel 4.x-dev is an alias of drupal/devel dev-4.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/devel dev-4.x requires doctrine/common ^2.7 -> satisfiable by doctrine/common[v2.7.0, ..., 2.13.x-dev].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/devel 4.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/devel[4.x-dev (alias of dev-4.x)].

Use the option --with-all-dependencies (-W) to allow upgrades, downgrades and removals for packages currently locked to specific versions.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.

As there is no 'unzip' nor '7z' command installed zip files are being unpacked using the PHP zip extension.
This may cause invalid reports of corrupted archives. Besides, any UNIX permissions (e.g. executable) defined in the archives will be lost.
Installing 'unzip' or '7z' (21.01+) may remediate them.
