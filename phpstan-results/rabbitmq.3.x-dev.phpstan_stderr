Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - php-amqplib/php-amqplib[v3.1.0, ..., v3.2.0] require ext-sockets * -> it is missing from your system. Install or enable PHP's sockets extension.
    - drupal/rabbitmq 3.x-dev is an alias of drupal/rabbitmq dev-3.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/rabbitmq dev-3.x requires php-amqplib/php-amqplib ^3.1 -> satisfiable by php-amqplib/php-amqplib[v3.1.0, v3.1.1, v3.1.2, v3.2.0].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/rabbitmq 3.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/rabbitmq[3.x-dev (alias of dev-3.x)].

To enable extensions, verify that they are enabled in your .ini files:
    - 
    - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-gd.ini
    - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-sodium.ini
    - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-zip.ini
    - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/memory.ini
You can also run `php --ini` in a terminal to see which files are used by PHP in CLI mode.
Alternatively, you can run Composer with `--ignore-platform-req=ext-sockets` to temporarily ignore these required extensions.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
