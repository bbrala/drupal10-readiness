Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - drupal/google_text_to_speech dev-2.x requires google/cloud-text-to-speech master -> found google/cloud-text-to-speech[dev-main, v0.1.0, ..., v0.6.1, v1.0.0, ..., v1.4.2] but it does not match the constraint. Perhaps dev-master was renamed to dev-main?
    - drupal/google_text_to_speech 2.x-dev is an alias of drupal/google_text_to_speech dev-2.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/google_text_to_speech 2.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/google_text_to_speech[2.x-dev (alias of dev-2.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
