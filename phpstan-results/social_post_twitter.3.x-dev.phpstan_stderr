Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - abraham/twitteroauth[0.7.0, ..., 0.7.4] require php ^5.6 || ^7.0 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - abraham/twitteroauth[0.9.0, ..., 0.9.2] require php ^5.6 || ^7.0 || ^7.1 || ^7.2 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - drupal/social_post_twitter 3.x-dev is an alias of drupal/social_post_twitter dev-3.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/social_post_twitter dev-3.x requires abraham/twitteroauth ~0.7 -> satisfiable by abraham/twitteroauth[0.7.0, ..., 0.9.2].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/social_post_twitter 3.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/social_post_twitter[3.x-dev (alias of dev-3.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
