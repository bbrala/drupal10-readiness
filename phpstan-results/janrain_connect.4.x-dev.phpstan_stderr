Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - janrainrest/janrainrest dev-master requires php ^7.1 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - drupal/janrain_connect 4.x-dev is an alias of drupal/janrain_connect dev-4.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/janrain_connect dev-4.x requires janrainrest/janrainrest dev-master -> satisfiable by janrainrest/janrainrest[dev-master].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/janrain_connect 4.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/janrain_connect[4.x-dev (alias of dev-4.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
