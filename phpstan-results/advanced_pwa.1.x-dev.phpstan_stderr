Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - minishlink/web-push[v4.0.0, ..., v4.0.2] require php ^7.1 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - drupal/advanced_pwa 1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/advanced_pwa dev-1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/advanced_pwa dev-1.x requires minishlink/web-push ^4.0 -> satisfiable by minishlink/web-push[v4.0.0, v4.0.1, v4.0.2].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/advanced_pwa 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/advanced_pwa[1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
