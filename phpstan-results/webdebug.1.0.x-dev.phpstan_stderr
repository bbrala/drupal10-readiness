Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - drupal/webdebug dev-1.0.x requires symfony/var-dumper ^4 -> found symfony/var-dumper[v4.0.0-BETA1, ..., 4.4.x-dev] but it conflicts with your root composer.json require (^5.4).
    - drupal/webdebug 1.0.x-dev is an alias of drupal/webdebug dev-1.0.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/webdebug 1.0.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/webdebug[1.0.x-dev (alias of dev-1.0.x)].

Use the option --with-all-dependencies (-W) to allow upgrades, downgrades and removals for packages currently locked to specific versions.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
