Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - civicrm/civicrm-core[dev-master, 5.40.0, ..., 5.50.x-dev] require ext-intl * -> it is missing from your system. Install or enable PHP's intl extension.
    - civicrm/civicrm-core[4.7.alpha1, ..., 4.7.24] require symfony/dependency-injection ~2.5.0 -> found symfony/dependency-injection[v2.5.0-BETA1, ..., 2.5.x-dev] but the package is fixed to v4.4.34 (lock file version) by a partial update and that version does not match. Make sure you list it as an argument for the update command.
    - civicrm/civicrm-core[4.7.25, ..., 4.7.31, 5.4.0, ..., 5.5.x-dev] require symfony/dependency-injection ^2.6.13 || ~3.0 -> found symfony/dependency-injection[v2.6.13, ..., 2.8.x-dev, v3.0.0-BETA1, ..., 3.4.x-dev] but the package is fixed to v4.4.34 (lock file version) by a partial update and that version does not match. Make sure you list it as an argument for the update command.
    - civicrm/civicrm-core[5.6.0, ..., 5.16.x-dev] require symfony/dependency-injection ^2.8.44 || ~3.0 -> found symfony/dependency-injection[v2.8.44, ..., 2.8.x-dev, v3.0.0-BETA1, ..., 3.4.x-dev] but the package is fixed to v4.4.34 (lock file version) by a partial update and that version does not match. Make sure you list it as an argument for the update command.
    - civicrm/civicrm-core[5.17.0, ..., 5.24.x-dev] require php ~7.0 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - civicrm/civicrm-core[5.25.0, ..., 5.34.x-dev] require php ~7.1 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - civicrm/civicrm-core[5.35.0, ..., 5.39.x-dev] require php ~7.2 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - drupal/civicrm_entity dev-3.x requires civicrm/civicrm-drupal-8 * -> satisfiable by civicrm/civicrm-drupal-8[dev-master, dev-resourceOrder, 5.0.0, ..., 5.50.x-dev, 9999999-dev].
    - civicrm/civicrm-drupal-8[dev-resourceOrder, 5.7.0, ..., 5.22.x-dev] require civicrm/civicrm-core >=5.4.0 -> satisfiable by civicrm/civicrm-core[5.4.0, ..., 5.50.x-dev].
    - civicrm/civicrm-drupal-8[dev-master, 5.23.0, ..., 5.50.x-dev] require civicrm/civicrm-core >=5.21.0 -> satisfiable by civicrm/civicrm-core[5.21.0, ..., 5.50.x-dev].
    - drupal/civicrm_entity 3.x-dev is an alias of drupal/civicrm_entity dev-3.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - civicrm/civicrm-drupal-8[5.0.0, ..., 5.6.x-dev] require civicrm/civicrm-core 4.7.* -> satisfiable by civicrm/civicrm-core[4.7.alpha1, ..., 4.7.31].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/civicrm_entity 3.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/civicrm_entity[3.x-dev (alias of dev-3.x)].

To enable extensions, verify that they are enabled in your .ini files:
    - 
    - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-gd.ini
    - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-sodium.ini
    - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-zip.ini
    - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/memory.ini
You can also run `php --ini` in a terminal to see which files are used by PHP in CLI mode.
Alternatively, you can run Composer with `--ignore-platform-req=ext-intl` to temporarily ignore these required extensions.

Use the option --with-all-dependencies (-W) to allow upgrades, downgrades and removals for packages currently locked to specific versions.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
