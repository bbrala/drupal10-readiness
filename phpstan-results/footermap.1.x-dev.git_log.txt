      * initial drupal-7 commit. module functionality working, but not tested.
         * had to work around some new draconian coding standards that throw notices everywhere despite being valid php.
         * changed $paths check to module_exists, should do this for other branches as well.

      * add optional cache support. since the footermap will change if you
        change a setting I had to compare the created times of 'variables'
        and 'footermap' to rebuild the cache on settings changes.

       * let's not show unpublished nodes.  this should work with both mysql and postgresql luckily.  substr and coalesce functions are the same ;-)
       * i can't compare node.status in SQL as the menu item for an unpublished node may contain a sub-menu that is active.  I don't know if that would ever be practical, but who the heck knows what people do.

       * allow admin to configure visible menus.
          * added avail_menus setting, array of menus
             * new function footermap_get_primary_menus() - possibly redundant but i don't have time atm.
          * modified footermap_get_menu()
             * new argument - $avail_menus is an array, on recurse it always has 1 item.
             * currently comparison is done outside of SQL due to drupal database core limitation (patch underway).  Instead of the foreach within the while it might be best to add a menu_name IN (%array).  Already done, but cannot commit unless core changes.

          * updated hook API (help & menu)
          * updated form API (footermap_settings)
          * updated database query for menu API, although still using recursive function for now.
          * modified level, has_children, and other vars respectively.  This should be adequate for the moment, but this is still in development until I can further test out the menu system i.e. i expect bugs
          * updated footermap.info to conform to .info API

    Switched from trying to filter the menu in sql to examining hex in php.  It is impossible to keep database abstraction with the former the way that 'menu.type' is structured (hex() vs to_hex() functions in mysql and postgresql respectively).  Instead anything that's divisible by 10 should be a disabled menu item.  It means there are more menu items to process in the while loop , but we'll take the chance since it's how drupal was designed anyway.

    1. Found cleanurl w/o using path.module bug.  I had originally attached $base_url to $h->path, but had taken it out during some testing.  This caused a bug to appear.  I have corrected things, and now $base_url is concatenated to $h->path if url_aliases are not used.  Additionally I have some weak regex to prevent messing around with external links such as when $h->path starts with "http" or "www".

    1. re-enabled paths feature after re-consideration.  Having the module do the extra query for paths even though it's easier to type in the alias in the menu is a bit lazy, but less work for my boss amongst other web designers.
    2. check for empty paths "" (i.e. menu categories).  Menu categories don't have paths associated with them.
    3. add css class "footermap-submenu" "footermap-item".
            A. The former lets users style the span associated with menu items that have submenus.
            B. The latter lets users style the span associated with a submenu item (without submenus of its own.)

    1. port over settings from DRUPAL-5 footermap over to HEAD/MAIN
    2. variable_get('menu_primary_menu', 0) is our base mid to compare to pid!  woot!  I knew it was dynamic ;-).  If top_menu is not defined use menu_primary_menu.  I'm not sure why you'd use top_menu now, but it's there for posterity.  Maybe you want to have some fun with menus.  This needs to be backported to DRUPAL-4-7.

    1. Removed div tag that was put in place for some custom hackery in the initial module.  forgot about it.
    2. Changed the css style name to 'footermap' from 'sitemap' to maintain naming standard.  There are other modules that may use 'sitemap' such as Site_Map or gsitemap.
