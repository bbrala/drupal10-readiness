Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - php-http/guzzle7-adapter 0.1.1 requires guzzlehttp/guzzle ^7.0 -> found guzzlehttp/guzzle[dev-master, 7.0.0-beta.1, ..., 7.4.x-dev (alias of dev-master)] but the package is fixed to 6.5.7 (lock file version) by a partial update and that version does not match. Make sure you list it as an argument for the update command.
    - lokalise/php-lokalise-api 3.1.0 requires php ^5.6 || ~7.0 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - drupal/tmgmt_lokalise dev-1.0.x requires lokalise/php-lokalise-api ^3.1 -> satisfiable by lokalise/php-lokalise-api[3.1.0, 3.x-dev (alias of dev-master)].
    - lokalise/php-lokalise-api 3.x-dev is an alias of lokalise/php-lokalise-api dev-master and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/tmgmt_lokalise 1.0.x-dev is an alias of drupal/tmgmt_lokalise dev-1.0.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - lokalise/php-lokalise-api dev-master requires php-http/guzzle7-adapter ^0.1.1 -> satisfiable by php-http/guzzle7-adapter[0.1.1].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/tmgmt_lokalise 1.0.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/tmgmt_lokalise[1.0.x-dev (alias of dev-1.0.x)].

Use the option --with-all-dependencies (-W) to allow upgrades, downgrades and removals for packages currently locked to specific versions.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
