  Problem 1
    - drupal/wysiwyg_template 2.0.0-beta1 requires ckeditor/templates 4.5.7 -> could not be found in any version, there may be a typo in the package name.
    - drupal/wysiwyg_template[2.0.0-rc1, ..., 2.x-dev, 3.0.0-beta1] require ckeditor/templates 4.11.1 -> could not be found in any version, there may be a typo in the package name.
    - drupal/wysiwyg_template 3.0.0-rc1 requires ckeditor/templates 4.11.1 || 4.14.1 -> could not be found in any version, there may be a typo in the package name.
    - drupal/wysiwyg_template[3.0.0-rc2, ..., 3.0.x-dev] require ckeditor/templates 4.11.1 || 4.14.1 || 4.15.1 -> could not be found in any version, there may be a typo in the package name.
    - drupal/sector_jobs 1.0.x-dev is an alias of drupal/sector_jobs dev-1.0.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/sector_jobs dev-1.0.x requires drupal/wysiwyg_template * -> satisfiable by drupal/wysiwyg_template[dev-2.x, dev-3.0.x, 2.0.0-beta1, ..., 2.x-dev, 3.0.0-beta1, 3.0.0-rc1, 3.0.0-rc2, 3.0.x-dev].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/sector_jobs 1.0.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/sector_jobs[1.0.x-dev (alias of dev-1.0.x)].

Potential causes:
 - A typo in the package name
 - The package is not available in a stable-enough version according to your minimum-stability setting
   see <https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#minimum-stability> for more details.
 - It's a private package and you forgot to add a custom repository to find it

Read <https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/troubleshooting.md> for further common problems.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
