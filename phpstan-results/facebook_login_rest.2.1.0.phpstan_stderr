Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - facebook/graph-sdk[5.6.0, ..., 5.x-dev] require php ^5.4|^7.0 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - drupal/facebook_login_rest 2.1.0 requires facebook/graph-sdk ^5.6 -> satisfiable by facebook/graph-sdk[5.6.0, ..., 5.x-dev].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/facebook_login_rest 2.1.0 -> satisfiable by drupal/facebook_login_rest[2.1.0].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
