Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - m4tthumphrey/php-gitlab-api[9.13.0, ..., 9.19.x-dev] require php ^5.6 || ^7.0 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - drupal/gitlab_api 2.1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/gitlab_api dev-2.1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/gitlab_api dev-2.1.x requires m4tthumphrey/php-gitlab-api ^9.13 -> satisfiable by m4tthumphrey/php-gitlab-api[9.13.0, ..., 9.19.x-dev].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/gitlab_api 2.1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/gitlab_api[2.1.x-dev (alias of dev-2.1.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
