Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - doctrine/common[v2.7.0, ..., 2.7.x-dev] require php ~5.6|~7.0 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - doctrine/common[v2.8.0, ..., 2.8.x-dev] require php ~7.1 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - doctrine/common[v2.9.0, ..., 2.13.0] require php ^7.1 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - doctrine/common[2.13.1, ..., 2.13.x-dev] require doctrine/inflector ^1.0 -> found doctrine/inflector[v1.0, ..., 1.4.x-dev] but the package is fixed to 2.0.4 (lock file version) by a partial update and that version does not match. Make sure you list it as an argument for the update command.
    - drupal/devel_debug_log dev-1.x requires drupal/devel ^4.0.0 -> satisfiable by drupal/devel[4.0.0-rc1, ..., 4.x-dev].
    - drupal/devel_debug_log 1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/devel_debug_log dev-1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/devel[4.0.0-rc1, ..., 4.x-dev] require doctrine/common ^2.7 -> satisfiable by doctrine/common[v2.7.0, ..., 2.13.x-dev].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/devel_debug_log 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/devel_debug_log[1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)].

Use the option --with-all-dependencies (-W) to allow upgrades, downgrades and removals for packages currently locked to specific versions.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
