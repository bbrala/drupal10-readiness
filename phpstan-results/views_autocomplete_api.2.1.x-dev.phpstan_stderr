Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - drupal/views_autocomplete_api dev-2.1.x requires drush/drush ^10.0 -> found drush/drush[10.0.0-alpha1, ..., 10.x-dev] but it conflicts with your root composer.json require (11.0.3).
    - drupal/views_autocomplete_api 2.1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/views_autocomplete_api dev-2.1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/views_autocomplete_api 2.1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/views_autocomplete_api[2.1.x-dev (alias of dev-2.1.x)].

Use the option --with-all-dependencies (-W) to allow upgrades, downgrades and removals for packages currently locked to specific versions.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
