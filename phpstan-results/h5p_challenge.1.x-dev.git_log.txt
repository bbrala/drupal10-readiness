    Added Return-Path to message headers.
    
    There seems to be an issue with Mime Mail module that sets the Return-Path header to an non-compliant value if the header is missing.

    Used phpstan to find any existing issues and fix them.
    
    Most of the issues were related to dependency injection usage. A few of methods for H5PChallenge service class had typos in their names.

    Added all REST resource and added filters to previous ones.
    
    Newly added resource will return both challenges and responses delepding
    on filters provided. Allowed filters are from, until and user_id. It
    also supports pagination with page parameter and changing default limit
    value with limit parameter. This endpoint would only return challenges
    and responses for challenges that have user_id set (anonymous challenges
    are omitted). Also added from and until filters + pagination to already
    existing REST resources.

    Fixed issue with cached challenge settings.
    
    Changed from hook_page_attachments to hook_js_settings_alter as that
    does not seem to be caching that configuration data. In case of embed
    view for H5P content the code had to be changed and settings are loaded
    using AJAX call. This is the only way to keep the data fresh and bypass
    caches. Another possibility would be to fully prevent that view from
    being cached at all. Also changed order of user challenges on the
    listing page to show the newest ones at the top.

    results view. Added a simple statistics table current challenges listing

    Added a h5p_challenge_rest submodule
    
    This new module defines RESTful Wweb Services endpoints for getting all
    of the user challenges and all responses for a certain challenge. The
    data is loaded using existing fetch classes that are used for creating
    the responses. Each class would now have a normalizer to be used by the
    Drupal internals.

    Code had an undefined variable instead of getting the value from the
    challenge itself.

    Additional explanation text for challenge delete form
    
    Added an explanation to the challenge delete form in case the challenge
    can not be deleted yet. Only inactive (finished) challenges with results
    being sent are allowed to be removed. Sending results is part of the
    cron job that is also storing anonymous statistics about challenge usage
    in the system.

    a user was wrong, fixed that.

    Addded challenge delete functionality.
    
    Challenges could only be deleted by the owner with an additional
    consitions of being inactive (finished) with results being sent. This
    would keep it consistent with the logic for anonymous challenges and
    still generate statistics.

    Implemented showing single questions and their answers.
    
    Gradable questions from first level are being extracted and stored into
    the challenge data column. Children (sub squestions) from content that
    is embedded within the current one are being ignored. Example:
    H5P.Column with MultiChoce, QuestionSet and DragText would only have
    three questions, ignoring any additional ones from within the
    QuestionSet. Challenge would also be trying to capture all the xAPI
    events that belong to current content, send the data to the backend and
    store it within the newly added data column. CSV results have also been
    changed to include this information. Also added code to the challenge
    results page that would only be shown to the authenticated owner for as
    long as the code is still active. Created fetch class for challenge
    results and bastracted away some of the functionality there.

    of locally defined ones.

    Additional changes for challenges by authenticated user
    
    Added separate messages for anonymous and authenticated user. Changed
    challenge code field to allow NULL values. This is needed for user
    challenges that have alreayd ended as those should have the code
    removed. Changed challenge listing to show responsed in the order they
    were submitted.

    condition to only delete challenges created by an anonymous user. Fixed
    usage of deprecated db_delete() function.

    Allowed challenges to be created by authenticated users.
    
    Partially implemented features that allow authenticated users to create
    challenges that would be linked to their accounts. Current
    implementation would only add user identifier to certain tables and show
    list of all challenges created by some user. It would also automatically
    fill email address of creator of the challenge and name of participant.
    It would later allow the challenge results to be kept for a long periods
    of time, in case the creator was an authenticated user.

    Added tooltips to results page.
    
    Tooltips are created using Tippy.js library. Both Tippy.js and Popper.js
    have been defined as libraries using CDN, though it is considered to be
    a bad practice. Mastery level elements would have tooltips attached
    explaining what conditions apply.

    Changed code to prefer interfaces in case of DI.
    
    Enabling Devel module caused issues with some of the dependencies and
    needed a rewrite to use interfaces instead. Also added an interface for
    own H5PChallengeService, though that one was not required.

    Fixed newlines for challenge mails and content title.
    
    Challenge email messages had newlines as code instead of meaningful
    characters, that added &13#; to the end of each line. Made sure that
    translation system object is forced into a string representation before
    running the mail system logic. Code that fetched title for the entity
    challenge is attached to was incorrect, there is no meaningful way to
    determine the connection as only the field has data about H5PContent
    identifier, not the other way around. Changed the code to use the
    H5PContent specific title instead.

    Moved external scripts loading to Challenge JS
    
    All included scripts are packaged into a single file, external
    dependencies are not to be cached. At least not the Recaptcha JS
    solution. Also removed made sure that correct language is in the
    captcha. Removed uncommented hard-coded trsnaltation strings.

    Localization + content title
    
    Added ability to fetch the title of the content that the Challenge is
    attached to. Current implementation expects it to be a Node. Implemented
    localization and loaded that into the JS context (it would be better to
    have a direct way to inject data into H5PIntegration or at least some
    part of it; that could have made it all a lot easier). Updated README
    file.

    More feratures and code clean-up.
    
    Implemented challenge results view and downloading resuts as CSV. Also
    addded hook_cron that would trigger the jobs. Both jobs are fully
    functional and should behave as expected. Have made some clean-up to the
    codebase. Challenge should be fully functional with all bulk of the
    features implemented. Some parts of the codebase are still incomplete
    and the code would benefit from better error handling and additional
    clean-up.

    Implemented challenge playing and finishing logic.
    
    Added logic that would allow user to participate in challenges. Changed
    the databae structure by removing unnecessary fields. Added a langcode
    field that would later be used when sending email notifications for
    ended challenges. The codebase is still rather rough and has remnants of
    badges logic in certain places that would have to be removed later.

    Added skripts and styles. Implemented some of the functionality.
    
    Copied JS ansd CSS from Oppevara specific challenge module. JS file
    would still require changes such as removal of badges related
    functionality, making code compatible with new backend and Drupal
    version 8 (most probably many others as well). Implemented db storage
    for challenges and points. Added ability to create new challenges. Made
    sure that recaptcha keys and email address used could be configured. The
    code would require a lot of changes and should not be used yet as
    changes to the database are most probably expected.
