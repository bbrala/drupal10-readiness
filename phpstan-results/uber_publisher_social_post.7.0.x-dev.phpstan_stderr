  Problem 1
    - abraham/twitteroauth[0.7.0, ..., 0.7.4] require php ^5.6 || ^7.0 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - abraham/twitteroauth[0.9.0, ..., 0.9.2] require php ^5.6 || ^7.0 || ^7.1 || ^7.2 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - drupal/uber_publisher_social_post dev-7.0.x requires drupal/social_post_twitter ~3.0 -> satisfiable by drupal/social_post_twitter[3.0.0-beta1, 3.0.0-beta2, 3.x-dev].
    - drupal/uber_publisher_social_post 7.0.x-dev is an alias of drupal/uber_publisher_social_post dev-7.0.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/social_post_twitter[3.0.0-beta1, ..., 3.x-dev] require abraham/twitteroauth ~0.7 -> satisfiable by abraham/twitteroauth[0.7.0, ..., 0.9.2].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/uber_publisher_social_post 7.0.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/uber_publisher_social_post[7.0.x-dev (alias of dev-7.0.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
