Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - bartfeenstra/fu[0.3.4, ..., 0.3.5] require php ~7.1 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - drupal/erg 1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/erg dev-1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/erg dev-1.x requires bartfeenstra/fu ^0.3.4 -> satisfiable by bartfeenstra/fu[0.3.4, 0.3.5].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/erg 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/erg[1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
