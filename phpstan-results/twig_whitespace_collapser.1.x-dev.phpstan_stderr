Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - matthecat/twig-whitespace-collapse-extension[v0.2.0, ..., v0.2.1] require twig/twig ~1.12 -> found twig/twig[v1.12.0-RC1, ..., 1.x-dev] but the package is fixed to v2.15.1 (lock file version) by a partial update and that version does not match. Make sure you list it as an argument for the update command.
    - drupal/twig_whitespace_collapser 1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/twig_whitespace_collapser dev-1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/twig_whitespace_collapser dev-1.x requires matthecat/twig-whitespace-collapse-extension ~0.2 -> satisfiable by matthecat/twig-whitespace-collapse-extension[v0.2.0, v0.2.1].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/twig_whitespace_collapser 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/twig_whitespace_collapser[1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)].

Use the option --with-all-dependencies (-W) to allow upgrades, downgrades and removals for packages currently locked to specific versions.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
