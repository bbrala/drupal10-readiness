  Problem 1
    - drupal/commerce[2.15.0, ..., 2.16.0] require drupal/core ^8.7 -> satisfiable by drupal/core[8.7.0-alpha1, ..., 8.9.x-dev] from composer repo (https://repo.packagist.org) but drupal/core[9.4.x-dev] from path repo (core) has higher repository priority. The packages from the higher priority repository do not match your constraint and are therefore not installable. That repository is canonical so the lower priority repo's packages are not installable. See https://getcomposer.org/repoprio for details and assistance.
    - drupal/commerce[2.17.0, ..., 2.x-dev] require ext-bcmath * -> it is missing from your system. Install or enable PHP's bcmath extension.
    - drupal/commerce[2.0.0-alpha1, ..., 2.0.0-alpha3] require drupal/core ^8 -> satisfiable by drupal/core[8.0.0-beta6, ..., 8.9.x-dev] from composer repo (https://repo.packagist.org) but drupal/core[9.4.x-dev] from path repo (core) has higher repository priority.

That repository is canonical so the lower priority repo's packages are not installable. See https://getcomposer.org/repoprio for details and assistance.
    - drupal/commerce 2.0.0-alpha4 requires drupal/core ~8.1 -> satisfiable by drupal/core[8.1.0-beta1, ..., 8.9.x-dev] from composer repo (https://repo.packagist.org) but drupal/core[9.4.x-dev] from path repo (core) has higher repository priority.

The packages from the higher priority repository do not match your constraint and are therefore not installable. That repository is canonical so the lower priority repo's packages are not installable. See https://getcomposer.org/repoprio for details and assistance.
    - drupal/commerce[2.1.0, ..., 2.4.0] require drupal/core ~8.4 -> satisfiable by drupal/core[8.4.0-alpha1, ..., 8.9.x-dev] from composer repo (https://repo.packagist.org) but drupal/core[9.4.x-dev] from path repo (core) has higher repository priority. The packages from the higher priority repository do not match your constraint and are therefore not installable.

The packages from the higher priority repository do not match your constraint and are therefore not installable. That repository is canonical so the lower priority repo's packages are not installable. See https://getcomposer.org/repoprio for details and assistance.
    - drupal/cmlstarter[1.0.0-beta1, ..., 1.11.0] require drupal/core ~8.0 -> satisfiable by drupal/core[8.0.0-beta6, ..., 8.9.x-dev] from composer repo (https://repo.packagist.org) but drupal/core[9.4.x-dev] from path repo (core) has higher repository priority. The packages from the higher priority repository do not match your constraint and are therefore not installable. That repository is canonical so the lower priority repo's packages are not installable. See https://getcomposer.org/repoprio for details and assistance.
    - drupal/cmlstarter 1.0.0-beta28 requires commerce/commerce_product 2.15 -> could not be found in any version, there may be a typo in the package name.
    - drupal/cmlstarter[1.0.0-beta27, ..., 1.0.0-beta30] require commerce/commerce_product ^2.15 -> could not be found in any version, there may be a typo in the package name.

    - drupal/cmlmerchant 1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/cmlmerchant dev-1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/commerce_product[dev-2.x, dev-3.0.x, 2.17.0, ..., 2.x-dev, 3.0.x-dev] require drupal/commerce * -> satisfiable by drupal/commerce[dev-2.x, dev-3.0.x, 2.0.0-alpha1, ..., 2.x-dev, 3.0.x-dev].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/cmlmerchant 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/cmlmerchant[1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)].

Potential causes:
 - A typo in the package name
 - The package is not available in a stable-enough version according to your minimum-stability setting
   see <https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#minimum-stability> for more details.
 - It's a private package and you forgot to add a custom repository to find it

Read <https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/troubleshooting.md> for further common problems.

To enable extensions, verify that they are enabled in your .ini files:
    - 
    - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-gd.ini
    - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-sodium.ini
    - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-zip.ini
    - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/memory.ini
You can also run `php --ini` in a terminal to see which files are used by PHP in CLI mode.
Alternatively, you can run Composer with `--ignore-platform-req=ext-bcmath` to temporarily ignore these required extensions.

Use the option --with-all-dependencies (-W) to allow upgrades, downgrades and removals for packages currently locked to specific versions.
