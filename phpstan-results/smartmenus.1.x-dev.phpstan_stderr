  Problem 1
    - drupal/smartmenus dev-1.x requires drmonty/smartmenus 1.1.1 -> found drmonty/smartmenus[dev-master, v0.9.6, v0.9.7, 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.1.0] but it does not match the constraint.
    - drupal/smartmenus 1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/smartmenus dev-1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/smartmenus 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/smartmenus[1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
