Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - drupal/automatic_updates dev-2.x requires composer/composer ^2.2.12 || ^2.3.5 -> found composer/composer[dev-main, 2.2.12, ..., 2.4.x-dev (alias of dev-main)] but the package is fixed to 2.1.12 (lock file version) by a partial update and that version does not match. Make sure you list it as an argument for the update command.
    - drupal/automatic_updates 2.x-dev is an alias of drupal/automatic_updates dev-2.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/automatic_updates 2.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/automatic_updates[2.x-dev (alias of dev-2.x)].

Use the option --with-all-dependencies (-W) to allow upgrades, downgrades and removals for packages currently locked to specific versions.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
