Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - mradcliffe/xeroclient[0.2.0, ..., 0.2.x-dev] require php ^7.0 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - drupal/xero 1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/xero dev-1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/xero dev-1.x requires mradcliffe/xeroclient ~0.2.0 -> satisfiable by mradcliffe/xeroclient[0.2.0, 0.2.x-dev].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/xero 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/xero[1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
