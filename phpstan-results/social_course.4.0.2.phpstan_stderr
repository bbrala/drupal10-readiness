Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/social_course 4.0.2 -> satisfiable by drupal/social_course[4.0.2].
    - drupal/social_course 4.0.2 requires php ^7.4 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
