Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - drupal/drip_webform_handler dev-1.0.x requires drupal/core ^8.9 -> satisfiable by drupal/core[8.9.0-beta1, ..., 8.9.x-dev] from composer repo (https://repo.packagist.org) but drupal/core[9.4.x-dev] from path repo (core) has higher repository priority. The packages from the higher priority repository do not match your constraint and are therefore not installable. That repository is canonical so the lower priority repo's packages are not installable. See https://getcomposer.org/repoprio for details and assistance.
    - drupal/drip_webform_handler 1.0.x-dev is an alias of drupal/drip_webform_handler dev-1.0.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/drip_webform_handler 1.0.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/drip_webform_handler[1.0.x-dev (alias of dev-1.0.x)].

Use the option --with-all-dependencies (-W) to allow upgrades, downgrades and removals for packages currently locked to specific versions.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
