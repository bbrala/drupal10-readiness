Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - phpoffice/phpword 0.17.0 requires php ^5.3.3 || ^7.0 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - drupal/entity_word 2.x-dev is an alias of drupal/entity_word dev-2.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/entity_word dev-2.x requires phpoffice/phpword 0.17.0 -> satisfiable by phpoffice/phpword[0.17.0].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/entity_word 2.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/entity_word[2.x-dev (alias of dev-2.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
