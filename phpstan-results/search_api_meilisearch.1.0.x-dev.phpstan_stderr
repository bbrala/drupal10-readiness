Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - meilisearch/meilisearch-php[v0.13.0, ..., v0.13.3] require php ^7.2 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - drupal/search_api_meilisearch 1.0.x-dev is an alias of drupal/search_api_meilisearch dev-1.0.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/search_api_meilisearch dev-1.0.x requires meilisearch/meilisearch-php ^0.13.0 -> satisfiable by meilisearch/meilisearch-php[v0.13.0, v0.13.1, v0.13.2, v0.13.3].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/search_api_meilisearch 1.0.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/search_api_meilisearch[1.0.x-dev (alias of dev-1.0.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
