Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - knplabs/github-api[2.10.0, ..., 2.11.0] require php ^5.6 || ^7.0 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - knplabs/github-api[2.12.0, ..., 2.x-dev] require php ^7.1 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - drupal/config_pr 1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/config_pr dev-1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/config_pr dev-1.x requires knplabs/github-api ^2.10 -> satisfiable by knplabs/github-api[2.10.0, ..., 2.x-dev].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/config_pr 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/config_pr[1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
