  Problem 1
    - drupal/field_encrypt_searchable dev-1.0.x requires drupal/encrypt ^2.0@alpha -> found drupal/encrypt[dev-3.x, 3.0.0-alpha1, ..., 3.x-dev (alias of dev-3.x)] but it does not match the constraint.
    - drupal/field_encrypt_searchable 1.0.x-dev is an alias of drupal/field_encrypt_searchable dev-1.0.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/field_encrypt_searchable 1.0.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/field_encrypt_searchable[1.0.x-dev (alias of dev-1.0.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
