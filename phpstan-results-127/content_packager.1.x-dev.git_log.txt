    Removed batch_size from configuration.  The value it brought was kind of low, especially now that zipping files is a separate operation of dubious value.

    Revised the zip behavior so that it's wholly independent of anything that happened during "copy files" operation.  Behavior is driven by a scan of the package directory contents.

    Switched directory checking to validator because it seems like it makes more sense there?  We want form errors to happen and prevent new values from being saved.

    Package directory cleanup happens if settings change or when the package is re-generated.  Have also restricted where a user can choose to put the package, and thus avoid accidentally causing the module to erase important files.
