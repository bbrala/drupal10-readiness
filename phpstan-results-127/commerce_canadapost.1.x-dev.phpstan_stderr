Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - thejacer87/canadapost-api v0.2.4 requires php ^5.5.9 || ^5.6 || ^7.0 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - drupal/commerce_canadapost 1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/commerce_canadapost dev-1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/commerce_canadapost dev-1.x requires thejacer87/canadapost-api ^0.2.4 -> satisfiable by thejacer87/canadapost-api[v0.2.4].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/commerce_canadapost 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/commerce_canadapost[1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
