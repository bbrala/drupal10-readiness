Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - m4tthumphrey/php-gitlab-api[9.18.0, ..., 9.19.x-dev] require php ^5.6 || ^7.0 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - drupal/vcs_provider_client 1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/vcs_provider_client dev-1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/vcs_provider_client dev-1.x requires m4tthumphrey/php-gitlab-api ^9.18 -> satisfiable by m4tthumphrey/php-gitlab-api[9.18.0, ..., 9.19.x-dev].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/vcs_provider_client 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/vcs_provider_client[1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
