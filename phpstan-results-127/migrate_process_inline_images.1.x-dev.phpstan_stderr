Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - drupal/migrate_process_inline_images dev-1.x requires symfony/dom-crawler ^3.4 -> found symfony/dom-crawler[v3.4.0-BETA1, ..., 3.4.x-dev] but it conflicts with your root composer.json require (^4.4 !=4.4.5).
    - drupal/migrate_process_inline_images 1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/migrate_process_inline_images dev-1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/migrate_process_inline_images 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/migrate_process_inline_images[1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)].

Use the option --with-all-dependencies (-W) to allow upgrades, downgrades and removals for packages currently locked to specific versions.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
