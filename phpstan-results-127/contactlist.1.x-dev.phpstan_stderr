Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - almaudoh/csvtools 0.9.x-dev requires php ^5.5.9 || ^7.0 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - drupal/contactlist 1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/contactlist dev-1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/contactlist dev-1.x requires almaudoh/csvtools ~0.9 -> satisfiable by almaudoh/csvtools[0.9.x-dev].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/contactlist 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/contactlist[1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
