Author: Gábor Hojtsy <gabor@hojtsy.hu>
Date:   Sun Jan 9 16:08:46 2011 +0000

    #1005436 by myself: Refactor, improve and expose translation history handling:
    
     - make the byline a link to get to further history information (AHAH if supported)
     - separate attribution information from history tracking (who the translation
       is attributed to vs. who submitted it)
     - fix upgrade path to use right table name to create the schema
     - separate type of action from medium of action (currently only meaningful for
       string additions but might be useful later for other stuff)
     - add fake entries for declined string to have some indication of them being
       previously declined (in case they are reactivated somehow)
     - add action type for re-additions, when previously declined strings get
       re-activated in the system (instead of making them look like new additions)
     - rework path callbacks for translation and source details
     - fix a we notices around project and release weights

    Numerous usability improvements:
    
     - make front page table include number of contributors per team, 100% wide, tweak headers
     - make top contributors per team a table not a list
     - rename contribute block to jump block, since it allows jumping around in essence
     - remove awfuly updated help blocks (never used on localize.drupal.org)
     - remove exessive text sometimes placed in place of jump box
     - place group board to close to group home
     - remove excessive link of generic download page on pages where we have or lead to downloads directly
     - add more downloads pointer on bottom of team download pages

    #595630 follow up by myself: rethink how connectors work and relate to localization server
    
    - Established new Localization server connectors module category.
    - Merge l10n_localpacks and l10n_project into l10n_drupal.
    - Migrate settings and database connector information to new module.
    - Move PEAR/Tar and potx requirement checking to l10n_drupal.
    - Reorganize settings page order and titles.
    - Move source code parsing warnings to l10n_drupal.
    - Move Drupal version detection to l10n_drupal.
    - Moved extractor.inc functionality fully to l10n_drupal.
      This was entirely Drupal specific.
    - Update tests to use new connector UI and l10n_drupal properly.
    - Added new hook_l10n_server_source_info() and hook_l10n_server_connector_info()
      hooks which are used to describe sources and connectors respectively.
      Separated the 'files' source from the 'drupal' connector to some degree.

    IMPORTANT UPDATE NOTICE: run update.php, because the code will expect the new table names, while the DB will have the old names.
    You already had l10n_community enabled, so just running updates without fiddling with enabling l10n_server first is fine.

    #595630 requested by Jose Reyero et. al, patch by myself: start separation of data level and UI level of l10n_server
    
    This introduces the l10n_server base module which is now required by l10n_community.
    The base module now provides the admin UI for projects and releases.
    Will move schema handling and expand admin functionality in future changes.
    
    UPDATE WARNING: manually edit l10n_community.info to comment out the l10n_server dependency
    before enabling l10n_server, or Drupal will not let you to. Then restore l10n_community.info.

    #715606 by myself: Updated tests to reflect the current reality of form elements and tools
    
     - /view and /edit now became /translate
     - changed plural assert to look for both strings in one structure now (more accurate test)
     - merged submitter checking now that we do not have individual callback paths (slightly less accurate test)
     - decline and approve actions now done on the same page via checkboxes and radio buttons
     - messages slightly changed when no source string is found
    
    Found issues along the way:
    
     - not all feedback messages were printed when submitting translations or .po files
     - suggestion additions always registered as a translation submission even if not directly approved
    
    Before patch: 1004 passes, 184 fails, 0 exceptions.
    After patch:  1130 passes,   0 fails, 0 exceptions, yay!
    (Less asserts due to how we check for singular/plural string and user submission info in a more compact fashion).

    #375817 by meba and myself: All kinds of performance optimizations and code cleanup:
    
     - denormalized release and project info into the file and line tables; now we can skip the release and file table if we need to filter for project - it is in the line table too
     - reworked language progress stats code to work much speedier
     - added caching to language progress stats for instant retrieval (cache is cleared on cron)
     - reworked query building for translate page to match the moderation page query builder
    
    Did both performance tests and run automated tests on the changes. All seem to be as good or better then before.

    #570648 in big part by Jose A Reyero with lots of work from myself: new filtering options and a mass moderation screen
    
     - Added user filtering to the Browse and Translate tabs; filters for users who submitted the active translation
     - Added custom limit support to listings, so people can work on less or more strings at once (eg. depending on certainty of the internet connection, one might want to do short submits and get translations in the database sooner)
     - Added a whole mass moderation screen based on code submitted by Jose A Reyero:
      - Ended up with reworking some subsystems like the filtering input handling (now uses an array instead of individual variables)
      - Unified code for the filtering form handling saved us from having lots of duplicate code in the mass moderation
      - Has all the usual filtering (except the suggestion status filter, since only lists suggestions)
    
    Automated testing for this functionality was written before this big patch was committed to ensure that everything works as it should and the functionality blends into the other screens. The Browse, Translate and Moderate screens now have a unified set of filters which all got extensive test coverage in [#560132].

    #560132 follow up by myself: added testing for project addition and basic code parsing:
    Added an l10n_test.module which purposefully lacks an .info file to not show up in the module list. But for potx it just looks like a module, so things like text in a menu hook are parsed.
    - Created a temporary packages directory and enabled l10n_localpacks to work with that.
    - Used Archive_Tar to tar up this l10n_test.module to a package.
    - Used the l10n_localpacks scanner to find, extract and parse the package.
    - Verified that the project and language lists now show up and the parsed project has a project page with one release known and parsed.

    #524112 by myself: initial support for contexts
     - database changed to support contexts
     - update function added
     - potx requirement check updated so it looks for 6.x-3.x traits
     - storage of strings updated to 6.x-3.x potx API, and stores context now
     - filtering with contexts added (only if server has context beyond the empty one == has D7 or modules)
       (otherwise it should not distrurb existing users)
     - some display of context was added
    
    TODO:
    
     - more display of context
     - support for contexts in import and export (not only parsing)

    #306373 and #332361 as well as other issues I found while fixing:
    
     - Second click on the suggestions icon now also brings back the editing field, just as with the lookup button introduced earlier.
     - Fixed the string IDs for plural strings to contain the right delimiter with a hyphen.
     - Fixed string copying code to look for the hyphen to identify plural strings and copy over all source strings to the editor.
     - Thanks to the previous point, we could eliminate all but the first copy button on plural strings, resulting in (#306373 being fixed).
     - Keep and document plural suggestion copying solution.
     - Solve case when parent is not the translation column but the source column, and switch to translation column for the pane display. This solves #332361.
     - Add number of plurals to page JS settings. Now used for string copying, but can be used for other things later.

    Break JOIN out to two very simple queries on string insert. The JOIN was invalid when inactive suggestions or translations from other languages resulted in the database not return rows, so it caused problems with the whitespace ensuring code. Now the source string is always found and the translation is queried in a second query.

    #321528 suggested by several users, also wished for by meba at http://drupal.org/node/196865#comment-763276: move away from sessions for permanent filters and implement GET param based filtering properly
    
      - Redirect on form submission with the right filter values kept intact in the URL
      - GET values are kept in pager links by Drupal automatically
      - We should keep GET values on form submission (done)
      - Reset button now redirect without keeping the filtering params
    
    This achieves URL based navigation without hidden session based magic. There is no need for the special permalinking feature, since all links are permalinks as much as possible (the list of untranslated stuff would change of course for example).

    Straight port of the Drupal 5 version to Drupal 6. Keeps the same functionality with
    some code cleanup. Focused on getting it work at this first pass including the
    interaction with potx and og.
    
    ALL:
     - All .info files updated to latest standard.
    
    l10n_community:
     - Form validation and submission handlers update for Drupal 6.
     - Code standard review findings fixed.
     - Updated to Drupal 6 language object / database structure.
     - Works with potx-6.x-2.x. Does not work with 6.x-1.x due to the new API used.
     - Nicely documented schema definition using Drupal 6 documentation features vs. the code comments in Drupal 5.
     - Custom menu wildcard loaders for language and project code.
       Requires latest Drupal 6.x development version because of the wildcard loading
       issue fixed in http://drupal.org/node/285165. Alternatively, patches for Drupal 6
       can be applied from there.
     - Moved adding CSS and JS to pages to hook_init() instead of hook_menu().
     - Updated settings page to latest Drupal 6 code.
     - Added hook_theme() for all theme hooks.
     - Killed some warnings and notices (which helped identify t - Killed some warnings and notices ).
    
    l10n_localpacks:
     - Updated hook_help() and hook_menu().
     - New validation for directory setting to help avoid setup problems.
    
    l10n_groups:
     - Nicely documented schema definition.
     - Updated setting the - Updatedp node type as an OG group node type to what OG uses in Drupal 6.
       Since this is an OG setting, it should take care of carrying it over from Drupal 5, when you
       upgrade from Drupal 5.
     - Form validation and submission handlers update for Drupal 6.
     - Updated and simplified hook_access() implementation.
    
    l10n_drupalorg:
     - Reuse existing language list in Drupal to fill in English name, native name and direction.
     - Updated to language codes known by Drupal 6 core.
     - Updated hook_help() and hook_menu().

       (but they still need to rescan everything unfortunately)
     - on export, unless the all-in-one format is used, output installer only strings to installer.po and output installer and runtime strings to installer.po as well

    Better export formats (reported in #193097, solution by myself, based on potx):
     - all-in-one export format for exporting standalone .po(t) files without compression
     - flat-package export format for exporting to CVS commit (until we abandon CVS for translations)
     - improved drupal-5 and drupal-6 formats, collapsing file names for smaller number of .po files

    Another batch of hopefully exciting but probably debated updates:
     - Down with the icons, hah. There are nice Unicode dingbats we can use, and we can color then however we want, even dynamically, as their role changes.
     - Fixed suggestion copying, which did not work due to an index check problem.
     - Implemented the suggestion decline feature, so suggestions can be declined one by one.
     - Got rid of the 'Expand' function as it was just a superfluos UI element, as the edit buttons are much more to the point on the original string, the suggestions and translations.

    "Merry Christmas" Localization Server Update with
    
     1. All new navigation interface. Direct jump form right on the first page, and
        more compact/fun "explore" pages for languages and projects. Project and
        language overview pages with quick stats.
    
     2. Separate view and edit tabs for translations, so those without permissions
        to translate can still enjoy viewing the stuff which is ready (also loads
        faster if you only look for information).
    
     3. Cross-project translation UI! Now project name is only a filter in the
        set of filters. This allows for easier modification and translation of
        strings of the same kind (ie. with same difficult words).
    
     4. Bookmarkable filters! When you browse around, the filters are remembered
        but (just as with Google Maps), you get a 'Link to this page' link, which
        you can bookmark or send around to your team, pointing to the exact filter
        you were using at the time on the exact view and page number you were at.
    
     5. Team centric user interface. Language home page sports a column where
        specifically tagged nodes appear. Also highlights contributors with big
        quantities of translations. User profile pages show off a summary of
        translation contributions, links back to translation team page.
    
     6. Moved all help to a sidebar block, which becomes are own "Clippy" of sorts.
        This makes the form controls appear in the same vertical position on the
        page in most themes, which makes for an easier to follow UI.
    
     7. Added a robot deterrent meta tag, so robots *will not index* l10n_server
        pages. This is to help you not suffer performance problems when googlebot
        comes around. This is an application, so indexing of its content has not
        much use.
    
     8. Added ability to review marker errors in all releases of a project. This
        will eventually fed back to drupal.org, but a local overview is handy.
    
    Some smaller improvements:
    
     - projects now know their "home URL", so we can direct translators to a
       download location easily
     - l10n_localpacks: project release files are only parsed if the file time
       is newer then when we last seen it
     - fixed export bug when the folder structure was not properly created in
       exports for Drupal 6
     - part of fixing #188737 by using "random" temp folders, so leftover files
       from previous, hanged runs will not stop the next run from executing, also
       allowing paralell processing of multiple packages
     - fix bug of presenting a UI to import translations (not suggestions only),
       when the user is only allowed to suggest
     - intentionally broken away from the symmetry with projects and languages,
       so the translation UI is only accessible from the languages page, but
       crosslinked from projects still
     - added missing breadcrumbs where it made sense for easier navigation
     - broken out translation UI from pages.inc to translation.inc as it
       grew quite big
     - updated some images, so they look better, and also added some supportive
       images for the new explore UIs
    
    This is the work of around two weeks free time, with some paper based prototyping
    and then hopefully consistent implementation all around. The translation interface
    itself is largely untouched, and will be part of a later UI update.
    
    There is one database update function to run, so go to update.php after
    updating to the new module suite code.

    New connector for local package translation:
     - Generalized package parsing code to make it much easier to write new connectors.
     - Added l10n_localpacks connector, which works based on data from a local directory,
       so basically allows Drupal development teams to use these tools to translate
       in-house projects.
    
    (You know I hope I'll not be the only one who maintains this code :)

    Break out organic groups dependency to a standalone module
     - makes l10n_community usable without og (and all its dependencies) both on
       test sites and in any other setting where full groups would be overkill
     - adds generic suggestion and approval permissions which are now used if
       groups are not enabled (and groups also require users to have these permissions
       AND be members or admins of groups to have proper permissions)
     - broke out help texts about group permissions to l10n_groups
    
    Also moved the welcome screen to the l10n_drupalorg module as it was also relevant for the community at large, so now this screen is optional.

    Huge cleanup of overview and translation interface HTML/CSS/JS:
     - removed extraneous HTML elements and wrappers
     - standardized on using sids, so temporary ids are removed
       (makes for less parameter passing, less confusion)
     - standardized names with sid numbers in them as HTML IDs, not classes
       (straightforward CSS and JS addressing of DOM elements)
     - minimized what data is required on AJAX calls
     - made more strings translatable
     - now using more meaningful classes, like rowhead cells and action image buttons
     - moved some inline JS code from the AJAX response to JS functions for management reasons
     - shoter names for often used items like 'translation' instead of 'new_translation'
     - better UI reflection on how suggestions are counted
     - standardized on existing translation display (although the brown used is kind of a placeholder)
     - read and fixed code comments, added where missing
     - fixed plural suggestion approval bug (actually missing feature)

Author: Gábor Hojtsy <gabor@hojtsy.hu>
Date:   Fri Sep 28 17:05:54 2007 +0000

    *MAJOR* architecture overhaul:
     - previously l10n_server and l10n_community were divided with the thinking
       that a different editing interface might be used on the same data
     - but real life discussions showed that a cool interface is supposed
       to be tied to different data sources
    
    So this upgrade separated the data sources (connectors) from the community interface.
    Now only the previously implemented l10n_drupalorg connector is here, but it is easy
    to implement others, as I'll do later.
    
    There are also some smaller bugs fixed, but otherwise a huge reorganization was enough
    for starters. I could not stop myself from cleaning up the suggestions architecture
    at the same time though. So now the history and suggestions are not stored separately,
    but are accessible from the same table (as inactive records for history values and as
    suggestion records for suggestions). Otherwise they use the same data as translations,
    so there was no reason to separate that out.
    
    I also fixed smaller import and export issues, so these operations work better.
    
    HTML and form structure cleanup is on the TODO list for the string editing interface,
    which will be hopefully followed by a great UI improvement session later.

      - added a lote more inline doc comments
      - improved phpdoc comments
    - reorganized some small amount of code to be more logical
    - added per-language import (quicker, without going to choosing a project, which is irrelevant for imports anyway)
    - cleaner text on the interface in most cases

    Suggestions improvements:
     - save imports as suggestions
       (if the user desires so, or if that is only what is possible)
     - let admins choose whether they want to save individual translations as suggestions
     - fix some UI

    Initial implementation of suggestions with AJAXy listing callback... there is a lot of usability to miss here, and the HTML is now also ready for some cleanup, but it is working now.

    Add support for permission models:
     - group admins can choose whether a group is open or restricted
     - in open groups, everyone can approve translations
     - in a restricted group, only group admins can do that

    usability improvements:
     - add title helps to toolbox buttons
     - use 'new' properly only on already translated strings
     - include user name and date of translation if viewing details of already translated string

    Another major update (and possibly the last before SoC is over, but this module will live on for sure :):
    
     - replaced unknown images with images from known source
       (known to be GPL), also from the same icon set
     - reorganized them to go to 'images', not 'img'
    
     - redone display of already translated strings, now the
       translator needs to proactively ask for the textarea
       for these to provide a new translation
    
     - made it possible to copy the previous translation to the
       editing field too
    
     - completely reworked the JavaScript to work as an add-on,
       now there are no buttons displayed, if there is no JS
       support in the browser, everything is added discretely
       (this makes it possible for mobile fanatics to translate
       from stripped down browsers, and such crazy stuff)
    
     - added an AHAH mechanism to retrieve detailed information
       on a string, which both saves us some performance, so we
       don't need to collect all the information on the initial
       page, but only on translator request, and it also helps
       declutter the interface.
    
    Everything seems to be working fine.

    another major update:
     - implemented exports, wohooo
        - generates a tgz file with the directory structure expected
          by Drupal 6 (translation folders, under module folders)
        - includes all file, line, revision, language and release
          information, as much as possible
        - allows translation template and translation package generation
     - also fixed a few notices
     - removed localeplus as we don't need anything from there

Date:   Fri Aug 17 21:54:42 2007 +0000

    actual counters added:
     - separated the string filtering and string counter API, so we have better tailored functions
       for source and translation counting and the actual translation pages
     - implemented the missing counters (not fast, but the query cache does cache it nicely for now)
     - removed suggestions related columns as this feature is not yet implemented
     - added todo page for template exports

    Protect the input form, so that only people with permission to translate could import

    another big overhaul with lots of new features:
     - menu structure changed:
        - lot less menu callbacks (only registering what we need at the meantime) -> smaller footprint
        - made the former l10nhome the default local task, so we can jump into groups.drupal.org if decided
        - added a few cacheable menu items, which are not dynamic
     - completed by-project listing pages and overviews, so these work fine
     - more action links in form for quicker work (tied to permissions)
     - implemented in status and release based filtering in translation form
     - keep being on the page where we were, when submitting translation form
     - inform user about changes made to strings when submitting a form
     - implemented PO import functionality with lightweight gettextapi.inc
       (this is going to obsolote the localeplus.inc inherited from lt_server)
     - better runtime permission caching for pages displaying multiple links,
       where permission information is required
     - reworded translation overview page to reflect that this will possibly
       run integrated into groups.drupal.org, not on a standalone site
     - solved project syncing bugs, and stripping cslashes from strings to store
     - removed unused stuff from localeplus.inc (left export related functions),
       so I know what can still be possibly useful from there

    massive rework of browsing, filtering and saving:
    
     - separated 'by language' and 'by project' starting points for browsing
       (previously only 'by language' was available) -> this should help opening
       browser tabs and navigating more cleanly (some screens still need to be implemented here)
    
     - separated the filtering form, made it remember what the user choose via session
       (so future requests and pager views retain the value), also made the search field
       active, so it can filter stuff now
    
     - got the translation saving up to date to the current database schema, now saves
       translations properly (temporarily removed the suggestion feature)
    
     - string selection with different option sets implemented (but needs more work)

    Reworked the translation form:
     - Added a filter UI (which is not functional yet)
     - Added plural forms support with a number of language dependent fields displayed for translation
     - Reworked JavaScript copy functionality to work with the updated form

    another significant update:
     - renamed teams to groups to be in line with the OG interface
     - take over site homepage and title when installed
     - add a default list of languages with plural forms (list from contrib HEAD translations)
     - better help text, and a new translatable homepage for the l10n_server site
     - add links to organic groups where applicable
     - temporarily use randomized data for overview pages to have a realistic look and feel
     - better behaviour when user has no permission to translate: display an overview
     - store errors when parsing a project
     - modified plural storage to store strings 'serialized' in a field, which is more performant in this case
     - added some stub code to the string query function to only deal with source strings for now

    Significant functionality update:
     - decoupled l10n_community schema from l10n_server
     - syncronized project module and l10n_server schema, using uri, title and other well known column names
     - instead of relating strings to projects (and only the latest 5.x release of a project),
       we have a list of projects, lists of project releases, lists of files in these releases,
       then the strings and connections between what line of a file a string appeared on...
       this achieves full sharing of strings between different lines, files, releases and projects
       (multiple string occurances on the same line are not counted, and are not planned)
     - migrated the code to the XML file interface of updates.drupal.org, instead of using the
       depreciated XML-RPC API, which will be discontinued
    
    There are lots of TODOs, including making less HTTP requests, and implementing project module
    backend sources for some of our needs to replace some stuf code in this update. The web
    translation interface is also completely broken with this update, will be brought in line
    later.

Author: Gábor Hojtsy <gabor@hojtsy.hu>
Date:   Tue Jul 3 20:56:01 2007 +0000

    lots of updates:
    l10n_server:
     - made it reuse potx, instead of copying it
     - redone the UI to simplify user interations
     - simplified the URL scheme
     - organized functions logically
     - fixed coding style issues, like single qoutes instead of double quotes
    l10n_community:
     - completely redone the UI, tabs instead of select boxes and arbitrary forms
     - abstracted common theme functions (copy icon, progress bar) out
     - constants instead of magic numbers
     - predictable help instead of global variable mangling
     - added more documentation
     - ordered the functions logically
    
    Lots more to come. These big changes are not the end.
