Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - drupal/migrate_upgrade dev-3.x requires drush/drush ^8 || ^9 || ^10 -> found drush/drush[8.0.0-beta11, ..., 8.x-dev, 9.0.0-alpha1, ..., 9.x-dev, 10.0.0-alpha1, ..., 10.x-dev] but it conflicts with your root composer.json require (11.0.3).
    - drupal/migrate_upgrade 3.x-dev is an alias of drupal/migrate_upgrade dev-3.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/migrate_upgrade 3.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/migrate_upgrade[3.x-dev (alias of dev-3.x)].

Use the option --with-all-dependencies (-W) to allow upgrades, downgrades and removals for packages currently locked to specific versions.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
