    Issue #3217353 by Ressinel: Zero permission user role. (#2377)
    
    * Issue #3217353 by Ressinel: As a SM I want to decide if new users are allowed to be an active part of the community.
    
    * Issue #3217353 by Ressinel: As a platform I want to have a way to distinguish verified users.
    
    * Issue #3217353 by Ressinel: Update behat tests, so we can test for verified users instead of “authenticated” when doing checks.
    
    * Issue #3217353 by Ressinel: Update autocomplete - Make sure a GM/EO can only add verified users.
    
    * Issue #3217353 by Ressinel: Update overviews - Make sure users with only the verified users are shown in the overviews/searches.
    
    * Issue #3217353 by Ressinel: As a platform I want to have a way to distinguish verified users.
    
    * Issue #3217353 by Ressinel: Update behat tests, so we can test for verified users instead of “authenticated” when doing checks.
    
    * Issue #3217353 by Ressinel: Add new behat tests to ensure authenticated users indeed can only consume content, and not interact with it (e.g. create new content, can’t comment, posts etc.)
    
    * Issue #3217353 by Ressinel: As a platform I want to have a way to distinguish verified users.
    
    * Issue #3217353 by Ressinel: As a SM I want to be able to mark users as (un)verified.
    
    * Issue #3217353 by Ressinel: Update overviews - Make sure users with only the verified users are shown in the overviews/searches.
    
    * Issue #3217353 by Ressinel: Give access to event enrollments list for verified users only.
    
    * Issue #3217353 by Ressinel: Special handling for the inevitable "Verified user" role in case when "Verified immediately" setting is enabled.
    
    * Issue #3217353 by Ressinel: Move away from our *_permission functions and to move to calling user_role_grant_permission with static arrays instead.
    
    This has a few benefits:
    1. This avoids some indirection which should make it clearer what is being assigned to what role
    2. We don’t automatically merge permission arrays. Drupal already does this so e.g. we don’t need to assign everything we assign to authenticated user, also to site manager. This helps move to thinking in roles as features rather than all-containing things.
    3. We can no longer call get_permissions from an update hook but instead need to explicitly specify what we’re updating. This makes permission changes more easy to trace and keeps the behaviour of update hooks the same throughout versions.
    
    * Issue #3217353 by Ressinel: Fix - files permission from 100755 to 100644
    
    * Issue #3217353 by Ressinel: Remove duplicate of adding 'access group search' permission.
    
    * Issue #3217353 by Ressinel: Correct the code comments.
    
    * Issue #3217353 by Ressinel: Disable unchecking Verified role only for the user create form when "Verified immediately" setting is enabled.
    
    * Issue #3217353 by Ressinel: Improve method for checking if a user is Verified.
    
    * Issue #3217353 by Ressinel: Move away from our *_permission functions and to move to calling user_role_grant_permission with static arrays instead.

    Issue #3134077 by ronaldtebrake,jochemvn, bramtenhove - Drupal 9 compatibility (#2144)
    
    We have added drupal core compatibility to our info.yml files to show all our custom work is compatible by using
    core_version_requirement: ^8.8 || ^9
    
    We have ensured to remove all deprecated code which is removed from Drupal 9. The replacement code is compatible with Drupal 8.9 as well so untill all our contributed modules are Drupal 9 ready, we are still installing Drupal 8.9.
    
    We have added phpstan as a github action, to make sure we wont be using any deprecated code anymore either. All new code will be ran at lvl 5 strictness as well, to ensure our code is also hold to a higher standard.

    * Issue 3130599 by AlanHDev: Fix typos in translatable strings and comments
    
    * Add fixed translations to `translations.php`
    
    This should ensure the strings don't accidentally disappear from Weblate
    for sites on older versions and can be removed once 8.3 is no longer
    supported.

    Merge branch '8.x-9.x' into feature/3120797-invite-event-enrollment
    
    I tried very hard to make sure all the conflicts are resolved correctly. If there are issues they are probably in the social_content_block module.
