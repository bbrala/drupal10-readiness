Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - spatie/schema-org 2.1.0 requires php ^7.0 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - drupal/structured_data_generator 1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/structured_data_generator dev-1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/structured_data_generator dev-1.x requires spatie/schema-org 2.1.0 -> satisfiable by spatie/schema-org[2.1.0].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/structured_data_generator 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/structured_data_generator[1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
