  Problem 1
    - drupal/decoupled dev-1.x requires drupal/xtcguzzle ^2.0 -> found drupal/xtcguzzle[dev-1.x, 0.1.0, ..., 0.6.0, 1.0.0, 1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)] but it does not match the constraint.
    - drupal/decoupled 1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/decoupled dev-1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/decoupled 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/decoupled[1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
