  Problem 1
    - lullabot/mpx-php[1.0.5, ..., 1.1.0] require cache/cache dev-master#83fabc5bad8b90f7981c97898345df8935b0bf55 -> found cache/cache[0.1.0, 0.2.0, 0.3, 0.4.0, 1.0.0, 2.0.x-dev] but it does not match the constraint.
    - drupal/media_mpx 1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/media_mpx dev-1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/media_mpx dev-1.x requires lullabot/mpx-php ^1.0.5 -> satisfiable by lullabot/mpx-php[1.0.5, 1.0.6, 1.1.0].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/media_mpx 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/media_mpx[1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
