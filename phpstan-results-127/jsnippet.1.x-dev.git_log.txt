    Issue #2993455 by song, jerdavis: Delete JS file after changing scope or removing snippet from list. Changed method for selecting external to being a test against the content of the snippet. The snippet is passed through PHP's filter_var and validated as a URL. If a URL is detected it's determined to be an external library, otherwise a file is generated and saved. If a snippet has a saved file but then gets switched to an external resource the saved file is deleted. If a snippet is deleted, the saved file is also deleted.
