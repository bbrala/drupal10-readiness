Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - sop/crypto-types 0.3.0 requires ext-gmp * -> it is missing from your system. Install or enable PHP's gmp extension.
    - drupal/oidc_menu dev-1.0.x requires drupal/oidc ^1.0 -> satisfiable by drupal/oidc[1.0.0-alpha1, ..., 1.x-dev].
    - drupal/oidc[1.0.0-alpha1, ..., 1.x-dev] require sop/jwx ^0.11.0 -> satisfiable by sop/jwx[0.11.0, 0.11.1].
    - drupal/oidc_menu 1.0.x-dev is an alias of drupal/oidc_menu dev-1.0.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - sop/jwx[0.11.0, ..., 0.11.1] require sop/crypto-types ^0.3.0 -> satisfiable by sop/crypto-types[0.3.0].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/oidc_menu 1.0.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/oidc_menu[1.0.x-dev (alias of dev-1.0.x)].

To enable extensions, verify that they are enabled in your .ini files:
    - 
    - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-gd.ini
    - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-sodium.ini
    - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-zip.ini
    - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/memory.ini
You can also run `php --ini` in a terminal to see which files are used by PHP in CLI mode.
Alternatively, you can run Composer with `--ignore-platform-req=ext-gmp` to temporarily ignore these required extensions.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
