Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - drupal/views_oai_pmh dev-1.x requires symfony/psr-http-message-bridge ^1.0 -> found symfony/psr-http-message-bridge[v1.0.0, ..., v1.3.0] but the package is fixed to v2.1.2 (lock file version) by a partial update and that version does not match. Make sure you list it as an argument for the update command.
    - drupal/views_oai_pmh 1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/views_oai_pmh dev-1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/views_oai_pmh 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/views_oai_pmh[1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)].

Use the option --with-all-dependencies (-W) to allow upgrades, downgrades and removals for packages currently locked to specific versions.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
