    Issue #2668420 by bryanbraun: fix extra padding and non-date centering.
    
    The extra padding was due to a CSS specificity error, but I also noticed
    that the padding wasn't adjusting when the content-type chooses not to
    display the publish date. That fix was included because it affects page
    padding as well.
