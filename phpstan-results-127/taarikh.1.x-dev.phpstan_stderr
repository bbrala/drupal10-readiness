Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - hussainweb/date-converter[v1.0-beta1, ..., 1.x-dev] require php ~5.6|~7.0 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - drupal/taarikh 1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/taarikh dev-1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/taarikh dev-1.x requires hussainweb/date-converter ^1.0 -> satisfiable by hussainweb/date-converter[v1.0-beta1, v1.0-beta2, 1.x-dev].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/taarikh 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/taarikh[1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
