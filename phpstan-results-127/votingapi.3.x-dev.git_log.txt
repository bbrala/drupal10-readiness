    Rolling back that update hook. The elimination of those indexes was unecessary, and for users without table prefixing, the drop happened without any problems. An additional drop index call would throw errors for *those* users, causing just as much confusion. I'll just suck it up and keep posting 'This doesn't hurt anything' in the issue queue.

    Some additional tweaks. Putting more power in the hands of votingapi_base_table_mapping() to define exactly how relationships should be constructed. Also, add a default tnid based join if Locale is enabled, not just Content Translation.

    First stab at #306567, support for multilingual votes. Votes cast using the 'translation_set' content type will be joined on tnid instead of nid when it comes time to retrieve views data. It's still up to modules that cast votes to decide whether node or translation_set, and nid or tnid, should be used based on their needs.

    Guess what! Views support is rewritten again. Now VotingAPI uses Views2 relationships to atach its data, making sorts and filters more reliable. As an added bonus, votes on users and comments and other base table data items can be displayed in views as well. See the API.txt for details.

Author: Jeff Eaton <eaton@lullabot.com>
Date:   Thu Jun 5 23:00:46 2008 +0000

    Cleaning up the join code for sorting and displaying values. Now it's possible to include an arbitrary number of values (i.e., total number of votes, average vote, median, etc...) in a single view.
    
    Views 2 FTW. It's Earl's world, we just live in it.

    Choked trying to account for the base table. We can't really support other base tables yet anyhow, so it's best not to try to until we get the details ironed out.

Author: Jeff Eaton <eaton@lullabot.com>
Date:   Thu Jun 5 21:11:18 2008 +0000

    Fixed a serious bug that kept VotingAPI from deleting old cache results, and added sorting by vote and result values to the Views integration. "List of nodes sorted by average rating" is finally possible again.

    Initial working version of Views2 integration for VotingAPI2.

Author: Jeff Eaton <eaton@lullabot.com>
Date:   Wed Apr 9 00:54:19 2008 +0000

    Several important bug fixes for the D6 version of VotingAPI. #223517, #232233, #232236, and #235174 fixed thanks to patches posted by quicksketch and sammys. Also checked in an initial stub file for views2 integration, removing the old hook_init() code since Views2 handles pulling the inc files in itself.

    Hooray for Drupal 5. Views integration is no longer inherent to the module; votingapi_views.module will be coming shortly.

commit 99fceaad23227b2af7589e9615c0e1810b5ba9f3
Author: Jeff Eaton <eaton@lullabot.com>
Date:   Wed Sep 27 03:20:18 2006 +0000

    First stab at a Drupal 5.0 conversion for VotingAPI. Important changes:
    
    votingapi_actions is now a completely separate but bundled module. It's very rough and its admin screens are not yet working w/5.0, but actions module hasn't been converted yet either so there's a bit of time.
    
    4.7-style Views integration has been removed. A new system is being worked on that's more reliable, pending a couple of important patches for Views module. Further updates as events warrant.

Author: Jeff Eaton <eaton@lullabot.com>
Date:   Sat Jun 10 04:38:00 2006 +0000

    Fixes for a silly error in the install file's update_9(), a minor fix in votingapi_actions.module, and the addition of votingapi_debug.module for developers. It offers a skeleton implementation of each VotingAPI hook, and when enabled, prints drupal_set_message() information each time a hook is called. It's spammy, but it can be helpful if you're new to VotingAPI and are trying to learn the module's internal workflow.

Author: Jeff Eaton <eaton@lullabot.com>
Date:   Fri Jun 9 00:15:01 2006 +0000

    As it turns out, my modules are the only ones that used hook_votingapi() directly. I've removed it in favor of the discrete hooks; SimpleVote and nmoderation will follow.
    
    Also, added support for taxonomy terms in the internal _votingapi_load_content() function.

    Better testing. Old-style 'modulename_votingapi()' impelementation now works alongside the new hooks. Old-style is now considered 'deprecated' -- it won't be going away right now, but developers are encouraged to move to the new more intuitive hooks.

    Internal function changes and assorted updates. A minor schema fix, and a VERY basic support for editing action sets via copy/paste.

Author: Jeff Eaton <eaton@lullabot.com>
Date:   Thu May 4 22:52:05 2006 +0000

    Renamed the cache handling function, to make it clear that other modules can call it to flush the action cache. Also, added a votingapi_delete_votes() function to batch-delete individual vote objects.

Author: Jeff Eaton <eaton@lullabot.com>
Date:   Wed May 3 03:03:35 2006 +0000

    Improved consistency of internal action set representation. Also, the first working checkin of votingapi_actions.module. It can list, enable/disable, and export action sets. Only really does anything if you're using the CVS version of SimpleVote right now.

    #61450 - some calls to db_query() had gone into the update functions. update_sql() now used instead.

commit 64a0a11c77accdfbb21f3f1d9b06e7403b0f9141
Author: Jeff Eaton <eaton@lullabot.com>
Date:   Tue May 2 04:25:19 2006 +0000

    The action loading and caching infrastructure has been made much more robust, and CRUD functions are in place for reading and writing user-created actions.
    
    voting_actions.module has now been added to facilitate direct user manipulation of action criteria, etc. It's the part that's still heavily under development. In many installations, it'll be unecessary.
    
    The votingapi_delete_vote() function no longer automatically recalculates. Modules using it should call recalculate manually after explicitly removing a vote.
    Those needing a consistent, stable VotingAPI should probably still stick with the 4.7 branch. This version will be branched as soon as the issues are ironed out.

Author: Jeff Eaton <eaton@lullabot.com>
Date:   Sat Apr 29 17:36:27 2006 +0000

    Fixed a silly bug that could throw user-visible errors if no action sets have been defined. Still need to work on the loading mechanism, but this should prevent php errors.

Author: Jeff Eaton <eaton@lullabot.com>
Date:   Sat Apr 29 17:19:26 2006 +0000

    More work on streamlining the actions system, and the beginnings of a UI for managing module-supplied voting action sets.
    
    Also, a new setting has been introduced -- vote result calculation can be deferred until cron-time. This can be useful on heavy-load sites where MANY votes are being cast and complex, db-intensive calculations are used to weight the results.

Author: Jeff Eaton <eaton@lullabot.com>
Date:   Mon Apr 24 02:32:35 2006 +0000

    Major enhancements to the actions subsystem, the addition of an experimental widgets library, and the (beginnings) of major enhancements to views integration.
    
    Using the latest CVS version of Views.module, it's now possible to display a particular vote result (say, the number of people who've voted) without using esoteric combinations of filters.

Author: Jeff Eaton <eaton@lullabot.com>
Date:   Sat Apr 22 15:45:29 2006 +0000

    Major development: there is now a working infrastructure for modules to expose their own 'voting actions' without requiring user customization. This is happy news. Further updates as events warrant.

Author: Jeff Eaton <eaton@lullabot.com>
Date:   Fri Apr 21 19:58:44 2006 +0000

    Still in-progress. Now supports initializing the voting actions cache by asking other modules what actions sets they implement.

Author: Jeff Eaton <eaton@lullabot.com>
Date:   Fri Apr 21 19:57:54 2006 +0000

    Expose public votingapi_add_vote and votingapi_delete_vote functions to allow modules to override normal behavior. This makes it possible to implement anonymous voting, though future explicit support is coming.

    Once again, very in-progress. Adding the first skeleton of a votingapi_action_handler. Each handler will be expected to implement three operations:
    
    process -- accept a bundle of vote-result data and return a true or false.
    
    fields -- accept a $comparison_value and return a collection of formapi elements used to edit them.
    
    save -- accept a collection of form elements and return a string (or serialized collection of data) to be saved as a $comparison_value

      In-progress version of the integrated voting actions code.
    
      This is a first pass, with nothing but the raw actions handling code. Still to do is a mechanism for other modules to add their own actions. After that, reworking voting_actions.module as a UI for user tweaking of the API functionality, rather than a standalone module.

    Lots of small but important fixes, courtesy dado. Thanks!
    
    #53512 - Vote and cache values correctly inserted as floats. (%f is your friend)
    #53499 - Incorrect use of %s in a query.
    #50748 - Added votingapi_get_vote_by_id($vote_id) for specific retrieval
    #53187 - deleting an individual vote now updates the cache, even if only the vote id is passed in.
    
    Also, fixed the .install file to support prefixed tables. Thanks, Bart Jansens!

    Added indexes to content_type and content_id fields, cleaned up some unecessarily long bits with the aggregate functions, and made the format $ops return sensible default values if no modules handle them.

    One more little tweak. VotingAPI auto-capitalizes tags/criteria if no other  module formats them.

    Important commit -- the data type of the value_type field has been changed to accomodate a wider range of voting systems, especially in situations when several are used on one site.
    
    If you're using the latest 4.7 cvs, hit your site's update.php, and run the VotingAPI updates. All existing table data will be converted automatically.
    
    A new votingapi $op is now available as well, allowing modules to format their own data for use in tables, etc. See SimpleVote module for an example.

    Exposing more bits via Views -- a listing of all individual votes cast for a particular node can now be created.

Author: Jeff Eaton <eaton@lullabot.com>

    Added quite a bit more stuff, including support for module-specific formatting of vote value strings, etc.

    Aded some additional filtering capabilities. It's now possible to create a Node Moderation view, with current voting results displayed. Module-overridden formatting of the result value coming shortly.

    First stab at Views integration with VotingAPI. Configuring it is a little ugly -- mainly useful for custom modules that want to expose a vote-based default_view without coding all the table/field/filter stuff for Views.

    Made IP logging more robust for proxied visitors, added additional function to retrieve all votes for a piece of content, keyed by uid:
    
    votingapi_get_content_votes('node', 1);
    
    Thanks to Budda for the requests

    A first pass at explaining VotingAPI's inner workings. More to come soon -- this explains the basic flow, though it doesn't delve into complex issues like multicriteria voting or different value_types.

    Added an addition $op -- 'post calculate' -- for responses to vote calculations.
    Also added additional params ($content_type and $content_id) on the end of the 'calculate' op for cleaner filtering of incoming calculations.

    Added a convenience function to retrieve a single user's vote by type/nid/tag/etc. Someday, these helper bits should probably be consolidated into a streamlined set of functions, but for now it works.

    Major revisions. Votingapi now supports:
    Single or multi-criteria voting on arbitrary content
    Multiple types of votes (percentage votes, up-or-down voting, etc)
    Automatic calculation and caching of voting results data for efficient node sorting/filtering
    Hooks for other modules to implement additional voting types, or add new calculated data based on raw voting scores (adjusted_averages based on user karma, etc)
