Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - abraham/twitteroauth 0.7.4 requires php ^5.6 || ^7.0 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - drupal/get_tweets 1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/get_tweets dev-1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/get_tweets dev-1.x requires abraham/twitteroauth ^0.7.4 -> satisfiable by abraham/twitteroauth[0.7.4].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/get_tweets 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/get_tweets[1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
