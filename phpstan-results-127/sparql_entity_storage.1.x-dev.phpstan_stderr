Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - drupal/sparql_entity_storage dev-1.x requires easyrdf/easyrdf 1.0.0 as 0.9.2 -> found easyrdf/easyrdf[1.0.0] but the package is fixed to 1.1.1 (lock file version) by a partial update and that version does not match. Make sure you list it as an argument for the update command.
    - drupal/sparql_entity_storage 1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/sparql_entity_storage dev-1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/sparql_entity_storage 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/sparql_entity_storage[1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)].

Use the option --with-all-dependencies (-W) to allow upgrades, downgrades and removals for packages currently locked to specific versions.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
