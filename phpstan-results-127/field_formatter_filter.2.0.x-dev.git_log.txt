    Working tests that prove a success. The config needed to bootstrap it however may conflict a little with core, as I had to stub the concept of node.body and view_mode.node.teaser . This should not be my job... I guess this is why the tests usually invent random machine names every time they add a config...

    Removing the TextFilteredFormatter plugin - it was not the correct plugin for the job. Use formatter->getThirdPartySetting instead

    WORKING. Replaces the text format id with our preferred override.

    Update terminology - it's a text *format* not a text *filter* we are applying here. Indludes first cut at applying the preprocess_field hook for rendering.

    Introduced hook_field_formatter_third_party_settings_form as a text field *modifier* instead of a unique field_formatter plugin *replacement*.

    Successfully got the display plugin rendered, and its config form settings working, persistent, and with good descriptions. (However, this is not a field_formatter_settings method, it replaces the plugin altogethere, which is not what I intended.)

    Used dupal console to drupal generate:plugin:fieldformatter. The plugin NAME and ID are imitating the example names found in core: TextFilteredFormatter = {field_type}{variant}Formatter
