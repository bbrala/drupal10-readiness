    Forced a cache clear after node type settings change.
    
    Without this, the change doesn't seem to show up right away. There's probably a better way to clear/invalidate only the portions of the cache that are changing, but I'm not sure exactly how to do that.

    Rewrote the Node Type form submission handling.
    
    The old version seemed to require a cache clear to take effect, while this one does not.
