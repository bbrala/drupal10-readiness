Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - ankitpokhrel/tus-php v1.2.0 requires php ^7.1.3 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - drupal/tus 1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/tus dev-1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/tus dev-1.x requires ankitpokhrel/tus-php 1.2.0 -> satisfiable by ankitpokhrel/tus-php[v1.2.0].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/tus 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/tus[1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
