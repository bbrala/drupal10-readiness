Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - jketelaar/php-kiyoh-api 2.0.0 requires php ^5.5 || ^7.0 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - jketelaar/php-kiyoh-api[2.0.1, ..., 2.0.5] require php ~7.1 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - drupal/kiyoh_rating 1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/kiyoh_rating dev-1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/kiyoh_rating dev-1.x requires jketelaar/php-kiyoh-api ^2.0 -> satisfiable by jketelaar/php-kiyoh-api[2.0.0, ..., 2.0.5].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/kiyoh_rating 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/kiyoh_rating[1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
