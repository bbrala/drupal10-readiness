  Problem 1
    - drupal/media_entity[dev-1.x, dev-2.x, 1.0.0-beta1, ..., 1.x-dev, 2.0.0-alpha1, ..., 2.x-dev] require drupal/core ^8 -> satisfiable by drupal/core[8.0.0-beta6, ..., 8.9.x-dev] from composer repo (https://repo.packagist.org) but drupal/core[9.4.x-dev] from path repo (core) has higher repository priority. The packages from the higher priority repository do not match your constraint and are therefore not installable. That repository is canonical so the lower priority repo's packages are not installable. See https://getcomposer.org/repoprio for details and assistance.
    - drupal/media_entity[1.3.0, ..., 1.6.0] require drupal/core ~8.1 -> satisfiable by drupal/core[8.1.0-beta1, ..., 8.9.x-dev] from composer repo (https://repo.packagist.org) but drupal/core[9.4.x-dev] from path repo (core) has higher repository priority. The packages from the higher priority repository do not match your constraint and are therefore not installable. That repository is canonical so the lower priority repo's packages are not installable. See https://getcomposer.org/repoprio for details and assistance.
    - drupal/media_entity_kaltura 1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/media_entity_kaltura dev-1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/media_entity_kaltura dev-1.x requires drupal/media_entity * -> satisfiable by drupal/media_entity[dev-1.x, dev-2.x, 1.0.0-beta1, ..., 1.x-dev, 2.0.0-alpha1, ..., 2.x-dev].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/media_entity_kaltura 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/media_entity_kaltura[1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)].
