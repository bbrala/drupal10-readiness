Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - saintsystems/odata-client 0.5.2 requires php ^7.2 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - drupal/odata_client 2.x-dev is an alias of drupal/odata_client dev-2.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/odata_client dev-2.x requires saintsystems/odata-client 0.5.2 -> satisfiable by saintsystems/odata-client[0.5.2].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/odata_client 2.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/odata_client[2.x-dev (alias of dev-2.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
