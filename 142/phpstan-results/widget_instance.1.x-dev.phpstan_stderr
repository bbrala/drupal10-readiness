Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - e0ipso/schema-forms[v2.0.0, ..., v2.1.0] require php >=8.1 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - drupal/widget_instance 1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/widget_instance dev-1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/widget_instance dev-1.x requires e0ipso/schema-forms ^2 -> satisfiable by e0ipso/schema-forms[v2.0.0, v2.0.1, v2.1.0].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/widget_instance 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/widget_instance[1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
