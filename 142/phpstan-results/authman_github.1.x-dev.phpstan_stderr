  Problem 1
    - drupal/authman_github dev-1.x requires league/oauth2-github ^1.0@dev -> found league/oauth2-github[dev-main, 0.1.0, 0.2.0, 0.2.1, 0.2.2, 2.0.0, 3.0.0] but it does not match the constraint.
    - drupal/authman_github 1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/authman_github dev-1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/authman_github 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/authman_github[1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
