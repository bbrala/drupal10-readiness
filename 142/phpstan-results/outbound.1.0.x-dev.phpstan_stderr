  Problem 1
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/outbound 1.0.x-dev, found drupal/outbound[1.0.0, dev-1.1.x, 1.0.0, 1.0.0, 1.1.1, 1.1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.1.x)] but it does not match the constraint.


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
