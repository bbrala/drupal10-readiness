Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - drupal/graphql_compose dev-1.0.x requires symfony/string ^5.4 -> found symfony/string[v5.4.0-BETA1, ..., 5.4.x-dev] but the package is fixed to v6.0.2 (lock file version) by a partial update and that version does not match. Make sure you list it as an argument for the update command.
    - drupal/graphql_compose 1.0.x-dev is an alias of drupal/graphql_compose dev-1.0.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/graphql_compose 1.0.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/graphql_compose[1.0.x-dev (alias of dev-1.0.x)].

Use the option --with-all-dependencies (-W) to allow upgrades, downgrades and removals for packages currently locked to specific versions.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
