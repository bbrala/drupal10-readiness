  Problem 1
    - oomphinc/composer-installers-extender[v1.1.1, ..., v1.1.2] require composer-plugin-api ^1.0 -> found composer-plugin-api[2.3.0] but it does not match the constraint.
    - drupal/varbase_media[7.0.0, ..., 7.15.0] require drupal/core ^8 -> satisfiable by drupal/core[8.0.0-beta6, ..., 8.9.x-dev] from composer repo (https://repo.packagist.org) but drupal/core[9.4.x-dev] from path repo (core) has higher repository priority. The packages from the higher priority repository do not match your constraint and are therefore not installable. That repository is canonical so the lower priority repo's packages are not installable. See https://getcomposer.org/repoprio for details and assistance.
    - drupal/uber_publisher_author_profile[dev-4.x, dev-6.x, 4.x-dev, 5.0.0-alpha1, 6.x-dev] require drupal/core ^8 -> satisfiable by drupal/core[8.0.0-beta6, ..., 8.9.x-dev] from composer repo (https://repo.packagist.org) but drupal/core[9.4.x-dev] from path repo (core) has higher repository priority. The packages from the higher priority repository do not match your constraint and are therefore not installable. That repository is canonical so the lower priority repo's packages are not installable. See https://getcomposer.org/repoprio for details and assistance.
    - drupal/varbase_media[7.18.0, ..., 7.20.0] require npm-asset/dropzone ~4.0 -> could not be found in any version, there may be a typo in the package name.
    - drupal/varbase_media[7.21.0, ..., 7.x-dev] require drupal/core ^8.8.0 || ~9.0.0 -> satisfiable by drupal/core[8.8.0-alpha1, ..., 8.9.x-dev, 9.0.0-alpha1, ..., 9.0.x-dev] from composer repo (https://repo.packagist.org) but drupal/core[9.4.x-dev] from path repo (core) has higher repository priority. The packages from the higher priority repository do not match your constraint and are therefore not installable. That repository is canonical so the lower priority repo's packages are not installable. See https://getcomposer.org/repoprio for details and assistance.
    - drupal/uber_publisher_author_profile[dev-5.x, 5.x-dev] require drupal/core ~8.0 -> satisfiable by drupal/core[8.0.0-beta6, ..., 8.9.x-dev] from composer repo (https://repo.packagist.org) but drupal/core[9.4.x-dev] from path repo (core) has higher repository priority. The packages from the higher priority repository do not match your constraint and are therefore not installable.

    - drupal/uber_publisher_indepth dev-7.0.x requires drupal/uber_publisher_author_profile * -> satisfiable by drupal/uber_publisher_author_profile[dev-4.x, dev-5.x, dev-6.x, dev-7.0.x, 4.x-dev (alias of dev-4.x), 5.0.0-alpha1, 5.x-dev (alias of dev-5.x), 6.x-dev (alias of dev-6.x), 7.0.0, 7.0.x-dev (alias of dev-7.0.x)].
    - drupal/uber_publisher_author_profile 7.0.x-dev is an alias of drupal/uber_publisher_author_profile dev-7.0.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/uber_publisher_indepth 7.0.x-dev is an alias of drupal/uber_publisher_indepth dev-7.0.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/uber_publisher_author_profile 7.0.0 requires oomphinc/composer-installers-extender ^1.1.2 -> satisfiable by oomphinc/composer-installers-extender[v1.1.2].
    - drupal/uber_publisher_author_profile[dev-7.0.x, 7.0.x-dev] require drupal/varbase_media ~7.0 || 8.7.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/varbase_media[7.0.0, ..., 7.x-dev].

    - drupal/uber_publisher_author_profile 6.x-dev is an alias of drupal/uber_publisher_author_profile dev-6.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/uber_publisher_indepth 7.0.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/uber_publisher_indepth[7.0.x-dev (alias of dev-7.0.x)].

Potential causes:
 - A typo in the package name
 - The package is not available in a stable-enough version according to your minimum-stability setting
   see <https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#minimum-stability> for more details.
 - It's a private package and you forgot to add a custom repository to find it

Read <https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/troubleshooting.md> for further common problems.

Use the option --with-all-dependencies (-W) to allow upgrades, downgrades and removals for packages currently locked to specific versions.
