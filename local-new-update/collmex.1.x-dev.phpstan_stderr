Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - mjaschen/collmex[0.7.5, ..., 0.7.7] require php ^5.6.0 || ~7.0.0 || ~7.1.0 || ~7.2.0 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - drupal/collmex 1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/collmex dev-1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/collmex dev-1.x requires mjaschen/collmex ^0.7.5 -> satisfiable by mjaschen/collmex[0.7.5, 0.7.6, 0.7.7].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/collmex 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/collmex[1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
