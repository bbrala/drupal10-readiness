    1. Added patch for geolocation from https://www.drupal.org/project/geolocation/issues/3250268#comment-14349588 so that it doesn't breaks the date filters.
    2. Also, updated the filter yaml in _social_geolocation_alter_admin_people_view to match Drupal 9 views export style.

    in the postcode for Dutch addresses causes Nominatim to return no
    results.

    Fix Canada postal_code workaround
    
    The `$address->get` returns a `TypedData` reference. This is actually a
    class that has a reference to the value. When the value of the
    `$address` field is changed then so does the value of the `TypedData`
    object.
    
    Additionally when trying to return the value from `''` to its original
    value an error occurs. `TypedData` objects can not be converted to
    strings directly but `->getValue()` should be called.
    
    The fix is to retrieve a string value using `getValue()` from the typed
    data. This does not change and can be properly passed to `set` on the
    `$address` field when we're done with geocoding.

    field to be attached but page specific logic to still run. A check is
    added to see if the field exists before adding state configuration.

    Add new dependencies to composer
    
    The Social Geolocation module will fail without the address module
    present because we use classes from it. Additionally if the address
    module ever removes the CommerceGuys/Addressing library then our module
    will also break so we depend on it directly.
    
    The geocoder module is not yet removed from the composer.json because
    that may cause it to be removed from platforms without being uninstalled
    in Drupal.

    Remove geocoder dump configuration for address fields
    
    Although the geocoder module can not be uninstalled because it may be
    depended on by others, the configuration for the geocoding of Open
    Social address field is removed. This geocoding is now handled by the
    social_geolocation module using the geolocation module.
    
    The post_update hook that adds the configuration is also removed as it
    is no longer needed. The post_update hook that removes the configuration
    should have no effect if the configuration isn't there because it's safe
    to call `unset` on non-existant values.

    Separate form handling for search and people overview
    
    The people overview can work without search back-end so the logic for
    altering the forms is split among the modules. The common logic for
    adding things to the forms is extracted to a shared function and cleaned
    up slightly.
    
    The container type for the location filter is made configurable because
    it should be a fieldset on the people overview and a details panel on
    the search page. This fixes a visual bug that currently exists on the
    people overview.

    The update hooks are no longer used. Drupal doesn't actually need update
    hooks to exist in order and will automatically pick up the next highest
    number. If an update hook no longer needs to run then it's safe to
    remove.
    
    The next update hook does still need to be 8004 because it will still
    need to execute on platforms that may have already ran 8003.

    Move query alter hook to views logic
    
    The solr_query_alter hook is triggered too late in the search processing
    which causes search_api_location options not to be applied. To resolve
    this we hook into the views query altering which runs before the query
    is handed to the API. By checking whether the query will be handled by
    the Search API SOLR backend we achieve the same behavior.

    Use AddressFormatter in address to string conversion
    
    The logic in `_social_geolocation_address_to_string` is changed so use
    the `DefaultFormatter` of the CommerceGuys/Addressing library. This
    formatter takes the locale of the country of the address into account to
    create a properly formatted address string.
    
    This fixes an issue caused by Nominatim and Google interpreting
    addresses from left to right by default expecting the country to be last
    for Western countries.
    
    Two examples that can be used in testing:
    
    'Netherlands, Enschede' will geocode to an address in the United States
    for a city called Netherlands. 'Enschede, Netherlands' will correctly
    geocode to the city of Enschede in The Netherlands.
    
    Both '4 Magnolia Ave., Santa Ana, CA, United States' and 'United States,
    CA, Santa Ana, 4 Magnolia Ave.' will geocode correctly to the
    corresponding address with the Google Geocoding API. However, using
    Nominatim. only the former will result in a correctly geocoded address
    and the country first format returns no results.
    
    Using the formatter from this library also ensures that postal codes are
    formatted correctly as the position of a postal code in an address
    varies widely between countries and can lead to incorrect geocoding.

    Fix the configurability of the used geocoder
    
    A configuration screen already existed to configure which geocoder
    plugin should be used. However, this wasn't actually wired up to affect
    any behaviour. The configuration is now used when loading the geocoding
    and the keys of the configuration values have been chosen so that they
    load the correct plugins.
    
    Configuration options are now only added to the form if the plugin for
    that option is enabled. This should help developers identify issues
    where the correct module was not yet enabled.

    Fix actual geocoding functionality
    
    The geolocation module doesn't do any geocoding on its own unless you're
    using the Google Maps widget. However, we want to use the Address field
    instead. As the Geocoder module has been eliminated there is now no
    geolocation being done at all.
    
    This commit reintroduces the logic that existed in the original version
    of the geolocation module to perform the geolocation for our supported
    entities.
    
    Additionally this commit starts using the configuration that exists to
    switch between different geocoder modules.
    
    Finally a site_manager_assist check is added to the configuration. This
    restores previously removed configuration that was used in some
    Enterprise sites while maintaining the simpler silent-fail as used on
    most SaaS sites.

    Introduce Social Geolocation Search module
    
    The Social Geolocation Search module is introduced to hold the
    configuration and alter hooks for supporting search in the Social
    Geolocation module. Since the `search_api_location` module is required
    for this to work it's better to move this into a 'connector' module
    than to force users of the geolocation module to also have search
    enabled.
    
    This commit also adds the alter hook that makes geolocation search work
    with SOLR. It's easier to keep an alter hook for each back-end than it
    is to find a unified solution that works with both.
    
    Some configuration changes have been made in how the geolocation module
    interacts with the address field which causes the actual geocoding to
    break.

    Remove geocoder dependency
    
    The geocoder and geolocation module have a lot of overlap and using them
    interchangeable can cause issues. The geolocation module has all the
    features we need and is required for the Social Geolocation Maps module
    to work, as well as helping us implement easier Search support in the
    future. Therefor the Geocoder module is removed as a dependency so that
    we reduce the total number of dependencies on sites using this module.

    Issue #3078925 by robertragas, Kingdutch: Convert country code to Full name for better geocoding results
    
    This commit removes a faulty fallback that undoes the conversion of the
    country code that was added in a previous commit. This fixes the issue
    described in #3078925 and makes the patch there unneccessary.
    
    The fallback did nothing else than the function call already did and did
    this when the function call was succesful instead of when it failed.
