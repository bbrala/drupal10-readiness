Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - drupal/cookie_content_blocker dev-1.x requires php ^7.1 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - drupal/cookie_content_blocker 1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/cookie_content_blocker dev-1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/cookie_content_blocker 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/cookie_content_blocker[1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
