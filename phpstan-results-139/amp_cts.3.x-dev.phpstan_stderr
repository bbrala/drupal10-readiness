Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - drupaljedi/css-tree-shaking 1.1.0 requires symfony/css-selector ^3 -> found symfony/css-selector[v3.0.0-BETA1, ..., 3.4.x-dev] but it conflicts with your root composer.json require (^4.4).
    - drupal/amp_cts 3.x-dev is an alias of drupal/amp_cts dev-3.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/amp_cts dev-3.x requires drupaljedi/css-tree-shaking ^1.1 -> satisfiable by drupaljedi/css-tree-shaking[1.1.0].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/amp_cts 3.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/amp_cts[3.x-dev (alias of dev-3.x)].

Use the option --with-all-dependencies (-W) to allow upgrades, downgrades and removals for packages currently locked to specific versions.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
