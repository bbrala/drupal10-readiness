  Problem 1
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/video_embed_jw_self_hosted 1.x-dev-dev, found drupal/video_embed_jw_self_hosted[dev-1.x, 1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)] but it does not match the constraint.


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
