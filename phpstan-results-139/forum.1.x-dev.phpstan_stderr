  Problem 1
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/core 9.4.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/core[9.4.x-dev].
    - drupal/forum 1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/forum dev-1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - Only one of these can be installed: drupal/forum[dev-1.x], drupal/core[9.4.x-dev]. drupal/core replaces drupal/forum and thus cannot coexist with it.
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/forum 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/forum[1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
