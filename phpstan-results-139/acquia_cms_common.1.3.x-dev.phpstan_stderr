Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - spatie/ssl-certificate 1.21.0 requires php ^7.2 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - spatie/ssl-certificate 1.22.1 requires ext-intl * -> it is missing from your system. Install or enable PHP's intl extension.
    - drupal/acquia_cms_common dev-1.3.x requires drupal/acquia_contenthub ^2.25 -> satisfiable by drupal/acquia_contenthub[2.25.0, ..., 2.x-dev (alias of dev-2.x)].
    - drupal/acquia_contenthub 2.x-dev is an alias of drupal/acquia_contenthub dev-2.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/acquia_contenthub 2.34.0 requires acquia/contenthub-console ^1.5 -> satisfiable by acquia/contenthub-console[1.5, 1.6].
    - drupal/acquia_contenthub[2.31.0, ..., 2.33.0] require acquia/contenthub-console ^1.4 -> satisfiable by acquia/contenthub-console[1.4, 1.5, 1.6].
    - drupal/acquia_contenthub[2.27.0, ..., 2.30.0] require acquia/contenthub-console ^1.3.1 -> satisfiable by acquia/contenthub-console[1.3.1, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6].
    - drupal/acquia_contenthub[2.25.0, ..., 2.26.0] require acquia/contenthub-console ^1.3.0 -> satisfiable by acquia/contenthub-console[1.3.0, ..., 1.6].
    - drupal/acquia_contenthub dev-2.x requires acquia/contenthub-console dev-main -> satisfiable by acquia/contenthub-console[dev-main].
    - drupal/acquia_cms_common 1.3.x-dev is an alias of drupal/acquia_cms_common dev-1.3.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - acquia/contenthub-console 1.3.0 requires spatie/ssl-certificate 1.21 -> satisfiable by spatie/ssl-certificate[1.21.0].
    - acquia/contenthub-console[dev-main, 1.3.1, ..., 1.6] require spatie/ssl-certificate 1.21|1.22.1 -> satisfiable by spatie/ssl-certificate[1.21.0, 1.22.1].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/acquia_cms_common 1.3.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/acquia_cms_common[1.3.x-dev (alias of dev-1.3.x)].

To enable extensions, verify that they are enabled in your .ini files:
    - 
    - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-gd.ini
    - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-sodium.ini
    - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-zip.ini
    - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/memory.ini
You can also run `php --ini` in a terminal to see which files are used by PHP in CLI mode.
Alternatively, you can run Composer with `--ignore-platform-req=ext-intl` to temporarily ignore these required extensions.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
