Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - drupal/drupal is present at version 9.4.x-dev and cannot be modified by Composer
    - drupal/twig_remove_html_comments 1.x-dev conflicts with drupal/drupal *.
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/twig_remove_html_comments 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/twig_remove_html_comments[1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
