  Problem 1
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/coder 8.3.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/coder[8.3.x-dev].
    - drupal/coder 8.3.x-dev requires squizlabs/php_codesniffer ^3.7.1 -> found squizlabs/php_codesniffer[dev-master, 3.7.1, 3.x-dev (alias of dev-master)] but the package is fixed to 3.6.1 (lock file version) by a partial update and that version does not match. Make sure you list it as an argument for the update command.

Use the option --with-all-dependencies (-W) to allow upgrades, downgrades and removals for packages currently locked to specific versions.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
