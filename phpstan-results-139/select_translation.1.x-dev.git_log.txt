    Use $this->t() instead of t() in the view filter plugin
    
    Using $this->t() in Object Oriented code is considered a good practice.

    Issue #2879534 by miteshmap: don't use type hints on primitive types
    
    In PHP 5 using type hints in function signatures for primitive types is
    only allowed when the default value is NULL, otherwise there are errors
    like the following:
    
      PHP Fatal error:  Default value for parameters with a class type hint
      can only be NULL in .../select_translation/select_translation.module
    
    So don't use type hinting for string parameters to keep compatibility
    with PHP 5.

    Use the '#states' field instead of the '#dependency' mechanism
    
    Using '#states' is the preferred mechanism for Drupal 8.
    
    Use the 'enabled' state instead of the 'visible' state because this way
    the UI does not change drastically, and the user has a more predictable
    experience.

    Use the name $lang_list for the second one: it reflects better the
    meaning of the variable.

    SelectTranslation.php: only replace 'current' and 'default' when needed
    
    If the language code list is going to contain only one element, like in
    the case of the 'default_language_only' option, just use the actual
    default language and not the placeholder.
    
    This allows to move the code which walks the array to replace 'current'
    and 'default' inside the conditional block below, making it look a lot
    like what is done in select_translation.module.
    
    This is in preparation for some changes to share some code between the
    Views filter and the select_translation_of_node() API call.

    SelectTranslation.php: change the signature of node_access_join()
    
    To minimize the changes, during the port to drupal 8 the signature of
    node_access_join() was left unchanged even if the $join variable had
    really become an output only parameter, instead of an input/output one.
    
    So make node_access_join return the JoinPluginBase object directly and
    drop the $join function argument.
    
    While at it, also rename node_access_join() to nodeAccessJoin()
    following the coding standard rules.
    
    These changes fixes two phpcs errors in one go.

    SelectTranslation.php: simplify the code that builds the main part of the query
    
    The previous code was splitting the check on the original language in
    two separate conditional blocks with the condition one the reverse of
    the other, it was also using the $add_new_join flag to check if the
    exclude criteria needed to be added;
    
    However, by anticipating the application of the exclude criteria, the
    two conditional block mentioned above can be merged and the code can be
    simplified a lot.
    
    With the new code, the order of some conditions in the same AND group
    changes, but the final query is functionally equivalent to the previous
    one.

    for, use it instead of open coding the WHERE condition which is more
    error prone and can have a non-standard look into the final query.

    select_translation.module: port select_translation_of_node to drupal 8
    
    Make the API call select_translation_of_node() work with drupal 8.
    
    The following changes have been made compared to the drupal 6/7 version:
      - the second argument is now a string, if the caller wants to pass
        a preference list of language codes it has to do so using a comma
        separated list as one string;
      - if the node is not available, return NULL to the caller instead of
        the very same $nid passed to the function;
      - avoid some optimizations which were making the code more difficult
        to understand, in drupal 8 they should not be needed anyways because
        the info about the translations get already loaded when the node is
        loaded at the beginning of the function;
      - use the drupal 8 API;
      - return a Node object instead of an integer value; returning a nid
        does not make sense in drupal 8 because the translations are per
        entity, not per node ID;
      - update the documentation;
      - remove hook_views_api(), not available anymore in drupal 8.
      - remove hook_help() which does not work in its current implementation
        and it does not provide any essential info anyways, it can be added
        back later if really needed.

    Remove dead code about the 'include_content_without_translation' option
    
    The code relative to the 'include_content_without_translation' option
    was commented during the porting to drupal 8, because it is not trivial
    to implement this option, and maybe it does not even make sense in a D8
    context.
    
    So just remove the code for now.
    
    In case users requested it, the option could be added back in the
    future after some discussion.

    During the module port to drupal 8 the code relative to the
    'include_content_with_unpublished_translation' was not ported, fix that.
    
    In particular:
      - drop views_join() as it has been removed from drupal 8,
        node_access_join() has already be changed to make this OK;
      - rename add_relationship() to addRelationship() this is how the
        method in called in drupal 8;
      - rename the 'language' field to 'langcode'.

    Make the module actually work
    
    In D6 and D7 the node.tnid field was used to find groups of translations
    of nodes, but in drupal 8 this field does not exist anymore because
    translations are not per-node anymore, but per entity, so the same nid
    can show up in different languages in node_field_data.
    
    A summary of the changes which make the module work:
      - use the node_field_data table to perform the query;
      - use node_field_data.nid and node_field_data.langcode to filter nodes
        based on the translation preference,;
      - use "node_field_data.default_langcode = 1" to select the original
        language of a node
    
    The "include_content_without_translation" option has been disabled for
    now, because there is no immediate way in drupal 8 to characterize
    content without translations, and maybe it does not even make sense.

    Make the code run with drupal 8
    
    This is just an API conversion, the filter does not do what it's upposed
    to yet, the query needs to be rewritten because the database structure
    for handling translations of nodes has changed in drupal 8.
    
    The Views filter plugin is now discovered thanks to the annotation
    @ViewsFilter("select_translation_filter") in the source code.

    Rename files to match the project structure of a drupal 8 module
    
    Rename select_translation.info file to select_translation.info.yml
    because that's what drupal 8 expects from a module.
    
    Rename select_translation_filter_handler.inc to
    src/Plugin/views/filter/SelectTranslation.php to match the structure of
    a Views filter plugin for drupal 8.
    
    Note that the files content has not been changed, the files have only
    been renamed, to show the porting process step-to-step.

    Don't join on rows who's translation ids are zero, thus eliminating duplicates.

    Add option not to include content without translations (does not belong to a translation set, aka tnid = 0).
    By default, it is enabled.

commit 956f0ac270ba1e2df4b65eda923f41764b7890c6
Author: Alexandru Croitor <alexandru.croitor@wearepropeople.com>

    Fixed query to actually work for multiple language orders, by joining on translation ids between tables instead of node ids.
    Added a new option to allow overriding of the specified language order: whenever the current language is equal to the default site language, it will ignore the order specified, and will just return content of the default language. (Thanks hugronaphor)
    To do this, also had to wrap the join into a sub query, because domain / node_access added exists clauses to the left joined node tables. The sub query fixes that for now.

    Changed query to use left joins, instead of correlated sub-queries, which should prove to be a lot faster when there are a lot of nodes in the database.
