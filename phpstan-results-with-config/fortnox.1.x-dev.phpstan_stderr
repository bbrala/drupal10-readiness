Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - drupal/fortnox[dev-1.x, 1.x-dev] require php ^7.1 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - drupal/fortnox 1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/fortnox dev-1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/fortnox 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/fortnox[1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
