  Problem 1
    - drupal/marketo_ma dev-2.x requires marketo-api/marketo-rest-client dev-master -> found marketo-api/marketo-rest-client[dev-issue12_delete_objects, v0.0.1, ..., v0.0.5] but it does not match the constraint.
    - drupal/marketo_ma 2.x-dev is an alias of drupal/marketo_ma dev-2.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/marketo_ma 2.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/marketo_ma[2.x-dev (alias of dev-2.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
