Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - drupal/drush_tools dev-1.0.x requires drush/drush ^9|^10 -> found drush/drush[9.0.0-alpha1, ..., 9.x-dev, 10.0.0-alpha1, ..., 10.x-dev] but it conflicts with your root composer.json require (11.0.3).
    - drupal/drush_tools 1.0.x-dev is an alias of drupal/drush_tools dev-1.0.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/drush_tools 1.0.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/drush_tools[1.0.x-dev (alias of dev-1.0.x)].

Use the option --with-all-dependencies (-W) to allow upgrades, downgrades and removals for packages currently locked to specific versions.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
