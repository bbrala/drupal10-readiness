Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - drupal/datetime_min_max dev-1.x requires bower-asset/inputmask * -> could not be found in any version, but the following packages provide it:
      - craftcms/cms Craft CMS
      - yidas/yii2-bower-asset Bower Assets for Yii 2 app provided via Composer repository
      - yidas/yii2-composer-bower-skip A Composer package that allows you to install or update Yii2 without Bower-Asset
      - jamband/yii2-schemadump Generate the schema from an existing database
      - kriss/yii2-calendar-schedule Yii2 Calendar Schedule
      - craftcms/yii2-dynamodb Yii2 implementation of a cache, session, and queue driver for DynamoDB
      - demokn/yii2-composer-asset
      - lsat/yii2-bower-asset Bower Assets for Yii 2 app provided via Composer repository
      - jamband/yii2-ensure-unique-behavior This extension insert unique identifier automatically for the Yii 2 framework
      - kriss/yii2-amap Yii2 Amap
      - kriss/yii2-advanced Yii2 advanced project template, Frontend for API and Backend with AdminLTE
      - pixelandtonic/yii2-dynamodb Yii2 implementation of a cache, session, and queue driver for DynamoDB
      - blackhive/yii2-app-advanced Yii 2 Advanced Project Template
      - cliff363825/yii2-bower-asset Yii2 bower asset
      - kriss/yii2-geo Yii2 GEO
      - maiscrm/yii2-composer-bower-skip A Composer package that allows you to install or update Yii2 without Bower-Asset
      - myzero1/yii2-app-advanced Yii 2 Advanced Project Template
      - onyijne/ovy Onsen-UI 2 + Vue.js 2 + Yii2 Basic Project Template
      - projectchina/yii2-app-advanced Yii 2 Advanced Project Template
      - stiks/yii2-composer-bower-skip A Composer package that allows you to install or update Yii2 without Bower-Asset
      ... and 2 more.
      Consider requiring one of these to satisfy the bower-asset/inputmask requirement.
    - drupal/datetime_min_max 1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/datetime_min_max dev-1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/datetime_min_max 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/datetime_min_max[1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)].

Potential causes:
 - A typo in the package name
 - The package is not available in a stable-enough version according to your minimum-stability setting
   see <https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#minimum-stability> for more details.
 - It's a private package and you forgot to add a custom repository to find it

Read <https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/troubleshooting.md> for further common problems.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
