    Initial port of module to Drupal 8 (#5)
    
    Replace existing Drupal 7 files with the corresponding Drupal 8
    versions.
    
    Main SystemSetQueue class is replaced with a corresponding
    UniqueDatabaseQueue class.
    
    The new class uses the same approach as the Drupal 7 version by
    extending the existing schema with a new md5 field with an unique
    key and interpreting exceptions to be an indication of an existing
    item.
    
    The MD5 checksum is calculated using PHP because it is simpler
    (and potentially more portable) when using the Drupal 8 database API.
    
    The implementation is reduced a lot simpler by inheriting more of the
    methods from the parent DatabaseQueue class.
    
    Dependency on registry_autoload is dropped as the module is obsolete
    for Drupal 8.
    
    Update README accordingly. References to Queue UI have been dropped
    for now as there are no patches for the Drupal 8 version which
    can add support for this module.

    [BUGFIX] Conform createItem to the parent interface
    
    Duplicates should not throw an exception, since that exception is
    not documented in the interface and 3rd party modules would not
    expect it to be thrown. This is specially harmful for modules
    deciding the queue class at runtime, since they may not have a
    custom integration minding the exception.
    
    Since this is an API change, I will bump version to 2.x.

    [BUGFIX] Order by item_id for items with same created date
    
    This helps ensuring FIFO consistency.
