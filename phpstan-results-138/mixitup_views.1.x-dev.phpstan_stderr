  Problem 1
    - oomphinc/composer-installers-extender[v1.1, ..., v1.1.2] require composer-plugin-api ^1.0 -> found composer-plugin-api[2.3.0] but it does not match the constraint.
    - drupal/mixitup_views 1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/mixitup_views dev-1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/mixitup_views dev-1.x requires oomphinc/composer-installers-extender ^1.1 -> satisfiable by oomphinc/composer-installers-extender[v1.1, v1.1.1, v1.1.2].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/mixitup_views 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/mixitup_views[1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
