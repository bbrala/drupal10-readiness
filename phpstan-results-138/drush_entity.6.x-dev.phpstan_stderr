Info from https://repo.packagist.org: #StandWithUkraine
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - drupal/drush_entity dev-6.x requires sebastian/exporter ^4.0@dev -> found sebastian/exporter[4.0.0, ..., 4.0.x-dev] but the package is fixed to 3.1.4 (lock file version) by a partial update and that version does not match. Make sure you list it as an argument for the update command.
    - drupal/drush_entity 6.x-dev is an alias of drupal/drush_entity dev-6.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/drush_entity 6.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/drush_entity[6.x-dev (alias of dev-6.x)].

Use the option --with-all-dependencies (-W) to allow upgrades, downgrades and removals for packages currently locked to specific versions.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
