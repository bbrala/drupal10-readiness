Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - bjeavons/zxcvbn-php 0.4.0 requires php ^5.6 || ^7.0 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - drupal/password_strength 2.x-dev is an alias of drupal/password_strength dev-2.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/password_strength dev-2.x requires bjeavons/zxcvbn-php 0.4.0 -> satisfiable by bjeavons/zxcvbn-php[0.4.0].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/password_strength 2.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/password_strength[2.x-dev (alias of dev-2.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
