  Problem 1
    - drupal/commerce_realex dev-2.0.x requires globalpayments/php-sdk 1.3.3.1 -> found globalpayments/php-sdk[dev-three-ds-two, dev-heartland-recurring-fixes, dev-transit-amount-fix, dev-online-boarding-test, dev-master_backup, dev-master, dev-php56-correction, 1.0.0, ..., 1.3.3, 2.0.0, ..., 2.4.4, 3.0.0, ..., 3.1.1, 4.0.0, 4.0.1, 4.0.2, 4.0.3] but it does not match the constraint.
    - drupal/commerce_realex 2.0.x-dev is an alias of drupal/commerce_realex dev-2.0.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/commerce_realex 2.0.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/commerce_realex[2.0.x-dev (alias of dev-2.0.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
