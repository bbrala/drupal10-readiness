    Issue #2909157 by subhojit777: Unnecessary files removed
    
    - module file was empty, and hence removed.
    - The module will now rely on release updates, and Git commits rather than
      maintaining a CHANGELOG.

    Issue #2909157 by subhojit777: Code improvements
    
    - Tokens are only fetched if `show_link` is enabled. Earlier it was
      fetched nevertheless.
    - Link text is now generated directly from link path. Earlier it was
      checking whether the path is aliased or not, and then it was
      generating the link text. The check is now removed.
    - Link class is now generated directly. Earlier there was an `if`
      condition that checked whether it is set or not. The condition is now
      removed.
    - `render()` now returns renderable array. Earlier it was returning a
      string. This is changed as per the new Drupal core.

    Issue #2413525 by subhojit777: Test improvements
    
    - Instead of checking only the first views row, all the rows are now
      checked.
    - Number of node count is reduced.

Date:   Wed Sep 13 20:16:47 2017 +0530

    Issue #2413525 by subhojit777: Code improvements
    
    - Data type mentioned.
    - Instead of hard coding node count, it is now declared as a test-wide
      property.
    - Nodes are now created in `setUp()` rather than inside a test.
    - Instead of asserting whether the HTML of link image is present on the
      page, we are now using xpath. This new method if testing will make
      sure that the stable release of this module will not be blocked by
      https://www.drupal.org/node/2544110.

    Issue #2413525 by subhojit777: Tests corrected
    
    - Drupal code standard fixes.
    - Replaced deprecated method.
    - Note that we _have_ to use `WebTestBase` because the test is dependent
      on `drupalGetTestFiles()`.
