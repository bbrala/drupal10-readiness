    78247 -- move profile values into profile_values table.  migrated profile values from users table, data column, into proper place in profile_values table.  this was caused by a bug in the LT registration function.  also fixed LT update 2, which was corrupting the user data by inserting extra escape characters.  NOTE: if you ran a db upgrade on LT between March 13th, 2006, and August 16th, 2006, the serialized data in the data column of the users table was corrupted!  it's either missing necessary curly braces, or has extra escape characters that prevent the data from being properly unserialized.  custom repair of that data will be necessary if it needs to be recovered.

Author: Chad Phillips <chad@apartmentlines.com>
Date:   Sun Jul 9 21:09:01 2006 +0000

    disallowed selection of the anonymous user role as the pre-auth role--the new handling of roles in core makes this setting impossible. set it so the update code will automatically move the pre auth role to the auth user role if it is currently in the anon role. site maintainers are encouraged to create a new role w/ the same perms as the anon role, and set this new role as the LT pre-auth role--this will allow the same functionality as before (in this case it will also be necessary to manually add the new pre-auth role to any users who were unvalidated previous to this change.

    rearranged some code to take advantage of hook_form_alter for the existing user login block form--unfortunately, the toboggan block still has to be used for display, as some of the user login block display stuff can't be overridden yet.  this is a forward-looking change--as soon as output is overridable by modules, the toboggan block will be eliminated and all work will be done through the user login block.  the remaining supporting code has already been written for this, and will remain commented out until the changeover. the toboggan blocks have been merged into one block, where a setting exists for choosing between the login link and the collapsible block, and an option has been added to disable display of the logged in link
