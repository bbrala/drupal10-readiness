  Problem 1
    - abraham/twitteroauth[1.0.0, ..., 1.0.1] require php ^5.6 || ^7.0 || ^7.1 || ^7.2 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - abraham/twitteroauth 1.1.0 requires php ^7.2 || ^7.3 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - abraham/twitteroauth 1.2.0 requires php ^7.2 || ^7.3 || ^7.4 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - drupal/socialfeed 1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/socialfeed dev-1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/socialfeed dev-1.x requires abraham/twitteroauth ^1 -> satisfiable by abraham/twitteroauth[1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.1.0, 1.2.0].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/socialfeed 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/socialfeed[1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
