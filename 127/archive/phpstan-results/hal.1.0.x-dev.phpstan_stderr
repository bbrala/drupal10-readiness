  Problem 1
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/core 9.4.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/core[9.4.x-dev].
    - drupal/hal 1.0.x-dev is an alias of drupal/hal dev-1.0.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - Only one of these can be installed: drupal/hal[dev-1.0.x], drupal/core[9.4.x-dev]. drupal/core replaces drupal/hal and thus cannot coexist with it.
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/hal 1.0.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/hal[1.0.x-dev (alias of dev-1.0.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
