Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - spatie/browsershot[3.26.0, ..., 3.26.3] require php ^7.1 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - drupal/web_page_archive 4.x-dev is an alias of drupal/web_page_archive dev-4.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/web_page_archive dev-4.x requires spatie/browsershot ~3.26.0 -> satisfiable by spatie/browsershot[3.26.0, 3.26.1, 3.26.2, 3.26.3].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/web_page_archive 4.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/web_page_archive[4.x-dev (alias of dev-4.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
