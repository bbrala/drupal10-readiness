Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - gimler/guzzle-description-loader v0.0.4 requires symfony/yaml ~3.0 -> found symfony/yaml[v3.0.0-BETA1, ..., 3.4.x-dev] but the package is fixed to v4.4.44 (lock file version) by a partial update and that version does not match. Make sure you list it as an argument for the update command.
    - drupal/service_description 2.0.x-dev is an alias of drupal/service_description dev-2.0.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/service_description dev-2.0.x requires gimler/guzzle-description-loader ^0.0.4 -> satisfiable by gimler/guzzle-description-loader[v0.0.4].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/service_description 2.0.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/service_description[2.0.x-dev (alias of dev-2.0.x)].

Use the option --with-all-dependencies (-W) to allow upgrades, downgrades and removals for packages currently locked to specific versions.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
