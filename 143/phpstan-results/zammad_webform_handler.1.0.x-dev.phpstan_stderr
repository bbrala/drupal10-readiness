Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - zammad/zammad-api-client-php[2.0.0, ..., 2.0.4] require guzzlehttp/guzzle ^7 -> found guzzlehttp/guzzle[dev-master, 7.0.0-beta.1, ..., 7.4.x-dev (alias of dev-master)] but the package is fixed to 6.5.5 (lock file version) by a partial update and that version does not match. Make sure you list it as an argument for the update command.
    - drupal/zammad_webform_handler 1.0.x-dev is an alias of drupal/zammad_webform_handler dev-1.0.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/zammad_webform_handler dev-1.0.x requires zammad/zammad-api-client-php ^2 -> satisfiable by zammad/zammad-api-client-php[2.0.0, ..., 2.0.4].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/zammad_webform_handler 1.0.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/zammad_webform_handler[1.0.x-dev (alias of dev-1.0.x)].

Use the option --with-all-dependencies (-W) to allow upgrades, downgrades and removals for packages currently locked to specific versions.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
