  Problem 1
    - drush/drush is locked to version 11.0.3 and an update of this package was not requested.
    - drupal/subentity 1.x-dev conflicts with drush/drush >=11.
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/subentity 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/subentity[1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
