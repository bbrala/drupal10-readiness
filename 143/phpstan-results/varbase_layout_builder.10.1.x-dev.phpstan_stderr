Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - drupal/varbase_layout_builder dev-10.1.x requires composer/installers ~2.0 -> found composer/installers[dev-main, v2.0.0-alpha1, ..., 2.x-dev (alias of dev-main)] but it conflicts with your root composer.json require (^1.9).
    - drupal/varbase_layout_builder 10.1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/varbase_layout_builder dev-10.1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/varbase_layout_builder 10.1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/varbase_layout_builder[10.1.x-dev (alias of dev-10.1.x)].

Use the option --with-all-dependencies (-W) to allow upgrades, downgrades and removals for packages currently locked to specific versions.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
