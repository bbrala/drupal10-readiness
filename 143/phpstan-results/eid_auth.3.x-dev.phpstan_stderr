Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - sk-id-solutions/mobile-id-php-client[v1.0, ..., v1.1] require php ^7.2 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - drupal/eid_auth 3.x-dev is an alias of drupal/eid_auth dev-3.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/eid_auth dev-3.x requires sk-id-solutions/mobile-id-php-client ~1.0 -> satisfiable by sk-id-solutions/mobile-id-php-client[v1.0, v1.1].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/eid_auth 3.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/eid_auth[3.x-dev (alias of dev-3.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
