Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - spatie/ssl-certificate 1.21.0 requires php ^7.2 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - spatie/ssl-certificate 1.22.1 requires ext-intl * -> it is missing from your system. Install or enable PHP's intl extension.
    - drupal/acquia_cms_common[1.3.5-alpha1, ..., 1.3.5-alpha3] require drupal/core ~9.2.18 || ~9.3.12 -> satisfiable by drupal/core[9.2.18, ..., 9.3.x-dev] from composer repo (https://repo.packagist.org) but drupal/core[9.4.x-dev] from path repo (core) has higher repository priority. The packages from the higher priority repository do not match your constraint and are therefore not installable. That repository is canonical so the lower priority repo's packages are not installable. See https://getcomposer.org/repoprio for details and assistance.
    - drupal/acquia_cms_common[1.3.5-alpha4, ..., 1.3.5] require drupal/core ~9.2.20 || ~9.3.14 -> satisfiable by drupal/core[9.2.20, ..., 9.3.x-dev] from composer repo (https://repo.packagist.org) but drupal/core[9.4.x-dev] from path repo (core) has higher repository priority. The packages from the higher priority repository do not match your constraint and are therefore not installable. That repository is canonical so the lower priority repo's packages are not installable. See https://getcomposer.org/repoprio for details and assistance.
    - drupal/acquia_cms_common[1.3.5-alpha12, ..., 1.3.6] require drupal/core ~9.2.21 || ~9.3.16 -> satisfiable by drupal/core[9.2.21, ..., 9.3.x-dev] from composer repo (https://repo.packagist.org) but drupal/core[9.4.x-dev] from path repo (core) has higher repository priority. The packages from the higher priority repository do not match your constraint and are therefore not installable. That repository is canonical so the lower priority repo's packages are not installable. See https://getcomposer.org/repoprio for details and assistance.
    - drupal/acquia_cms_document[1.3.3-alpha1, ..., 1.3.x-dev] require drupal/acquia_cms_common ^1.3.5 -> satisfiable by drupal/acquia_cms_common[1.3.5-alpha1, ..., 1.4.0].
    - drupal/acquia_cms_common 1.3.x-dev is an alias of drupal/acquia_cms_common dev-1.3.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/acquia_cms_common[dev-1.3.x, 1.3.5-alpha13, ..., 1.4.0] require drupal/acquia_contenthub ^2.25 -> satisfiable by drupal/acquia_contenthub[2.25.0, ..., 2.x-dev (alias of dev-2.x)].
    - drupal/acquia_contenthub 2.x-dev is an alias of drupal/acquia_contenthub dev-2.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/acquia_cms_starter dev-1.3.x requires drupal/acquia_cms_document ^1.3.3 -> satisfiable by drupal/acquia_cms_document[1.3.3-alpha1, 1.3.3, 1.3.x-dev].
    - drupal/acquia_contenthub 2.34.0 requires acquia/contenthub-console ^1.5 -> satisfiable by acquia/contenthub-console[1.5].
    - drupal/acquia_contenthub[2.31.0, ..., 2.33.0] require acquia/contenthub-console ^1.4 -> satisfiable by acquia/contenthub-console[1.4, 1.5].
    - drupal/acquia_contenthub[2.27.0, ..., 2.30.0] require acquia/contenthub-console ^1.3.1 -> satisfiable by acquia/contenthub-console[1.3.1, 1.4, 1.5].
    - drupal/acquia_contenthub[2.25.0, ..., 2.26.0] require acquia/contenthub-console ^1.3.0 -> satisfiable by acquia/contenthub-console[1.3.0, 1.3.1, 1.4, 1.5].
    - drupal/acquia_contenthub dev-2.x requires acquia/contenthub-console dev-main -> satisfiable by acquia/contenthub-console[dev-main].
    - drupal/acquia_cms_starter 1.3.x-dev is an alias of drupal/acquia_cms_starter dev-1.3.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - acquia/contenthub-console 1.3.0 requires spatie/ssl-certificate 1.21 -> satisfiable by spatie/ssl-certificate[1.21.0].
    - acquia/contenthub-console[dev-main, 1.3.1, ..., 1.5] require spatie/ssl-certificate 1.21|1.22.1 -> satisfiable by spatie/ssl-certificate[1.21.0, 1.22.1].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/acquia_cms_starter 1.3.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/acquia_cms_starter[1.3.x-dev (alias of dev-1.3.x)].

To enable extensions, verify that they are enabled in your .ini files:
    - 
    - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-gd.ini
    - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-sodium.ini
    - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-zip.ini
    - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/memory.ini
You can also run `php --ini` in a terminal to see which files are used by PHP in CLI mode.
Alternatively, you can run Composer with `--ignore-platform-req=ext-intl` to temporarily ignore these required extensions.

Use the option --with-all-dependencies (-W) to allow upgrades, downgrades and removals for packages currently locked to specific versions.
