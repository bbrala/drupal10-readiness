Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - italia/spid-php-lib v0.35 requires php ^7.2 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - drupal/spid 2.x-dev is an alias of drupal/spid dev-2.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/spid dev-2.x requires italia/spid-php-lib v0.35 -> satisfiable by italia/spid-php-lib[v0.35].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/spid 2.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/spid[2.x-dev (alias of dev-2.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
