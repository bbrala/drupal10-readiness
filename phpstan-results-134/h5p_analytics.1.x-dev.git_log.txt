    LRS request log page.
    
    Added a page that would list paginated request logs. This currently
    excludes the successful requests and is mostly meant for debugging
    issues.

    Refactoring and admin menus.
    
    Introduced a method that would just send the statements data to LRS.
    That method is noe used by both connection test and sending data to LRS
    logic. Changed connection testing code to use the current values within
    the form and not the already stored ones as that was confusing. Changed
    the path to a module configuration page and included that into the admin
    menu. Also registered the statistics page as a submenu for the Reports.

    Fixed http log query logic + some small fixes here and there
    
    The query for HTTP log counts was incorrect, using a SUM() of statements
    counts in batches. That is unreliable as the same batch could have
    multiple http requests under certain circumstances. A count of all items
    for a certain code inthe log is now uses instead. There were a few typos
    and bugs that did not affect the functionality all that much. Added the
    long forgotten composer.json file as it now does point to the correct
    URLs.

    Remove usage of ANY_VALUE and replaced with subqueries.
    
    ANY_VALUE is not universally supported for MySQL and its derivatives.
    Rewtore the statistics queries to ue subquery instead, although it could
    also raise issues with older versions of MySQL.

    Added button to test connection.
    
    Currently, the same method of contacting the service is being used.
    This means that stored connection settings are being used and any
    unsaved changes are ignored. The statements sending method has a key to
    prevent data from being added to the request log.
