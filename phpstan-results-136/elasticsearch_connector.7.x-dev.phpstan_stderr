Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - nodespark/des-connector 7.x-dev requires php ^7.0 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - drupal/elasticsearch_connector 7.x-dev is an alias of drupal/elasticsearch_connector dev-7.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/elasticsearch_connector dev-7.x requires nodespark/des-connector 7.x-dev -> satisfiable by nodespark/des-connector[7.x-dev].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/elasticsearch_connector 7.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/elasticsearch_connector[7.x-dev (alias of dev-7.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
