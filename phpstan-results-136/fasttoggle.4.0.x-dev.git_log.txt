    #2596983: Use theme_links for fasttoggle links
    
    Right now, the links are being rendered directly within the content array,
    and are hard to organize in a drupal-sort of way. Wouldn't it make sense
    to use the links system to render them (like flag and other modules do)?
    
    This patch introduces that. It also cleans up the link function and allows
    eventually an alter to be added to the fasttoggle_user_link function so
    people could inject other links here. (its still somewhat hardcoded but at
    least a start).

    Rework access control.
    
    Rework the access control by having one central _allowed_links function
    that iterates over the results of _available_links, calling functions
    that have been lists in the config structure.
    
    Functions may operate at the site-wide level, group level or the level
    of an individual setting, and are provided parameters appropriate to
    the level.
    
    Each function should call either fasttoggle_deny_access_if() or
    fasttoggle_allow_access_if(), providing the boolean result of an access
    test as the sole argument. More than one test may be run in a function.
    
    If the test(s) in a function return FALSE, access is neither allowed or
    denied - following tests (if any) are given the opportunity to have
    their say. If the test (and hence the parameter) is TRUE, any remaining
    tests in that function will also be run, but none of the remaining tests
    that would be applied will be run. The result will be the outcome for this
    item and any children it has.
    
    If all test run without any given a definite answer for or against, the
    access to the toggle will be allowed.

    Stop adding active link when fasttoggling.
    
    l() adds the active class to links it generates, but we don't want
    that when replacing the HTML for a link because the original link
    didn't have that class. Fasttoggling a link should only change the
    description of the status or action, not the appearance of the link.
    
    This is ugly; perhaps the right solution is to get .active added to
    begin with, but I'm going with this behaviour for now.

    Port D6 patch for being able to toggle user roles.
    
    Port the Drupal 6 patch for being able to toggle user roles. As
    part of this, I discovered an error in the D6 code that I'll need
    to backport the fix for - we need a unique selector for each link
    as well as the class to be able to style links according to their
    status.
    
    I'm hoping that these changes also lay good groundwork for a big
    cleanup that will remove the node/user/comment specific versions
    of functions, replacing them with more generic functions that use
    callbacks & data instead. This will in turn hopefully make implementing
    fasttoggling in other modules a much easier task.

    Fix user toggling in admin/people.
    
    We previously added links to the list of users, allowing toggling
    of the blocked status from there. Fix these links. As part of this,
    we need to modify things to handle multiple links of the same kind
    on one page (ie put the user/node/comment ID in the class). We also
    need to modify fasttoggle to handle a third kind of link - the data
    we need to pop into the table cell for this interface and will need
    (assume) for the matching interface for nodes.
    
    One bit of ugliness in user_admin_account: its support for the
    operations column doesn't forsee others wanting to add additional
    operations there. We have to shift the data down beside ours, so
    that drupal_render can then properly render both the default edit
    link and our status link. We add a single space also, so that the
    links don't run together. Yuck.
    
    Oh, and this all started with doing support for optionally disabling
    toggling of the admin user's status, so that issue fix is in there
    too.
    
    TODO: I'm seeing extra CSS being added in admin/people when the
    link is toggled. See if I can prevent that somehow.

    Ajax progress. Working but not updating label
    
    Some progress. Ajax is now working, but we're not updating the
    label yet. The link also jumps to the left side while the Ajax
    is running... might be something in the changes from D6?
    
    Note to self: Also, looking at the code for setting the label, I
    think it might need fixing to properly handle the show the
    state vs action preference.

    - #112779 (part 1): Implemented quick publishing/unpublishing of comments
    - Added an API for JavaScript callback functions to alter the page when an option is toggled. This can for example add/remove the class 'node-unpublished' to the node container when the node is toggled to instantly visually reflect the state. This is imlemented for both nodes (sticky, published) and comments (published)
