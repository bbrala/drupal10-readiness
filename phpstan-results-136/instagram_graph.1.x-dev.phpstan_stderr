Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - facebook/graph-sdk 5.7.0 requires php ^5.4|^7.0 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - drupal/instagram_graph 1.x-dev is an alias of drupal/instagram_graph dev-1.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/instagram_graph dev-1.x requires facebook/graph-sdk ~5.7.0 -> satisfiable by facebook/graph-sdk[5.7.0].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/instagram_graph 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/instagram_graph[1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)].


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
