Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - spatie/ssl-certificate[1.19.0, ..., 1.21.0] require php ^7.2 -> your php version (8.0.2) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - spatie/ssl-certificate[1.21.1, ..., 1.22.1] require ext-intl * -> it is missing from your system. Install or enable PHP's intl extension.
    - drupal/cert 1.0.x-dev is an alias of drupal/cert dev-1.0.x and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - drupal/cert dev-1.0.x requires spatie/ssl-certificate ^1.19 -> satisfiable by spatie/ssl-certificate[1.19.0, ..., 1.22.1].
    - Root composer.json requires drupal/cert 1.0.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/cert[1.0.x-dev (alias of dev-1.0.x)].

To enable extensions, verify that they are enabled in your .ini files:
    - 
    - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-gd.ini
    - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-sodium.ini
    - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-zip.ini
    - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/memory.ini
You can also run `php --ini` in a terminal to see which files are used by PHP in CLI mode.
Alternatively, you can run Composer with `--ignore-platform-req=ext-intl` to temporarily ignore these required extensions.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
